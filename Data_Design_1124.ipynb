    "All matching is case-insensitive unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "    1. Extraction from primaryAppointment.title (Primary Source)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a researcher has a non-empty primaryAppointment.title, this field is treated as the most reliable indicator of academic rank or position.\n",
    "The title is normalized to lowercase, and the following ordered rules are applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Emeritus/Emerita detection (highest priority)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the title contains “emeritus” or “emerita”, the role is assigned accordingly (e.g., \"Professor Emeritus\").\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Visiting appointments\n",

    "\"Visiting Faculty\" (otherwise).\n",

    "\"Executive in Residence\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Artist in Residence\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Scholar in Residence\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Instructor\"\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Fallback\n",
    "\n",
    "If no rule matches, the role remains None and the overview text is used in the next stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extraction from overview (Fallback Source)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the role is still None after title-based matching, the researcher’s overview text is parsed using case-insensitive regular expressions. The extraction follows a priority order to prevent overly broad matches (such as “student”) from overriding more specific roles.\n",

    "(2) Graduate Student\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "(3) Director (capital D only)\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid false positives, only \"Director\" with capital D is matched → \"Director\"\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Student (lowest priority)\n",
    "\n",
