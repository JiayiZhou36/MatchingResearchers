                  "abstract": "Photon-counting detector (PCD) computed tomography (CT) promises improved resolution and contrast at reduced x-ray dose compared to energy-integrating detector (EID) CT. Our objective is to determine the parameters that achieve robust accuracy of quantitative measures in chest PCD-CT studies compared to quantitative EID-CT at low CT dose. The Kyoto LUNGMAN chest phantom with preserved lung tissue core and NIST-calibrated foam density standards (4-20 lbs.), and the COPD Lung Phantom II with six airways of various outer and inner diameters, were scanned using PCD-CT (NAEOTOM Alpha) and EID-CT (SOMATOM Force) with a target CT dose index (CTDIvol) of 2.2 mGy to match that specified for ongoing longitudinal quantitative chest CT studies of chronic lung disease. Mean density of foam inserts in the Kyoto phantom and mean lumen area (LA) and wall thickness (WT) of COPD Lung Phantom II were automatically segmented, analyzed, and compared using the root mean squared error (RMSE). Contrast-to-noise (CNR) and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios were also automatically calculated. Large (11.2 mm) and small (5.5 mm) airway LA and WT in the lung tissue core of the Kyoto phantom were semi-automatically measured. PCD-CT with the Qr40 kernel yielded superior foam density accuracy (RMSE: 6.1-7.8 HU) compared to EID-CT (RMSE: 9.7 HU). Q+UHR mode with Qr64 and a 1024 × 1024 matrix achieved the highest airway accuracy (RMSE <1.8 mm2for LA and <0.3 mm for WT). However, these protocols showed increased variability in tracheal air measurements (SD up to ±9 HU), indicating a trade-off between higher spatial resolution and measurement repeatability. At equivalent low radiation dose (2.2 mGy CTDIvol), PCD-CT outperforms EID-CT in quantitative accuracy for foam density and airway measurements, with comparable SNR and CNR. These results support the use of PCD-CT for quantitative lung imaging in longitudinal studies, provided reconstruction settings are selected to balance accuracy and repeatability.",

For broad adoption across the medical imaging community, VIT tools should not only be accurate but also robust and user-friendly. PURPOSE: To develop a validated, end-to-end CT simulation framework with script-based and graphical user interfaces (GUIs), packaged for simple installation and robust performance across diverse computing environments. METHODS: A previously-validated CT simulator (DukeSim) was packaged into an end-to-end framework with four major components: (1) a web-based GUI inspired by clinical scanner consoles, (2) a Python wrapper script serving as a flexible entry point, (3) a physics-based CT projector utilizing ray-tracing and Monte Carlo methods, and (4) a vendor-neutral reconstruction module (MCR Toolkit) supporting both filtered back-projection and iterative techniques. The web-based GUI was developed based on NodeJS and Express server configuration to select the protocol and scanner configurations and to initiate the CT simulations. The integrated DukeSim software was built in three types of packages, with rigorous version control, testing, bug tracking, and release processes. Further, the software's capabilities and potential utilities were demonstrated by developing sample scanner models mimicking the attributes of legacy CT scanners. RESULTS: The integrated CT simulation framework was successfully developed, enabling seamless adoption and broad applicability in virtual imaging trials. Additionally, the modeling and validation of legacy scanners demonstrated the framework's capability to accurately represent a variety of clinically relevant scanners. CONCLUSIONS: This work represents a major advancement in CT simulation tools, providing an end-to-end, validated, and robust solution for virtual imaging trials. The software's flexibility to model various CT technologies, combined with its user-friendly interface and validated accuracy, positions it as a valuable tool for advancing research in CT technology development, assessment, and optimization.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate liver fat quantification is essential for early diagnosis and effective management of fatty liver disease. PURPOSE: To investigate the potential clinical utility of a deep silicon-based photon-counting CT (dSi-PCCT), currently in development, for liver fat quantification using human models in an in silico imaging study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: dSi-PCCT is a cutting-edge photon-counting CT (GE HealthCare), with several investigational systems installed globally, used under IRB approval for imaging animals and human volunteers to support FDA clearance. We developed a dSi-PCCT simulator and benchmarked its imaging performance with respect to a prototype. We imaged a computational Gammex phantom with fat fractions (FF) ranging from 0% to 100%, along with five XCAT human models with liver FF ranging from 1% to 50%, using an abdominal CT protocol. The resulting spectral sinograms were processed using a material decomposition (MD) technique. We calculated HU-based Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) from single-energy images in XCAT models and compared it against the MD-derived FF. The MD-derived FF of both datasets was assessed against the digitally defined ground truth values. RESULTS: We observed a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.98) between MD-derived, HU-based PDFF, and ground-truth FF in a Gammex and XCAT models. There was no statistically significant difference (P = .52) in FF quantification accuracy between Gammex and the XCAT human models. The root mean square errors were 4.7% for Gammex and 2.7% for XCAT. Bland-Altman analysis further confirmed good agreement between the ground truth and MD-derived FF, with differences in FF ranging from -6.9% to 7% for Gammex and -3.0% to 37.6% for XCAT. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that dSi-PCCT could enable accurate liver fat quantification across a wide range of FFs in multiple objects. These findings suggest that the potential utility of dSi-PCCT for accurate liver fat assessment should be explored in vivo.",

In this proof-of-principle study, a deep learning approach to multi-material decomposition was developed to quantify iodine, gadolinium, and calcium in spectral CT. A dual-phase network architecture was trained using synthetic datasets containing computational models of cylindrical and virtual patient phantoms. Classification and quantification performance was evaluated across a range of patient size and dose parameters. The model was found to accurately classify (accuracy: cylinders - 98%, virtual patients - 97%) and quantify materials (mean absolute percentage difference: cylinders - 8-10%, virtual patients - 10-15%) in both datasets. Performance in virtual patient phantoms improved as the hybrid training dataset included a larger contingent of virtual patient phantoms (accuracy: 48% with 0 virtual patients to 97% with 8 virtual patients). For both datasets, the algorithm was able to maintain strong performance under challenging conditions of large patient size and reduced dose. This study shows the validity of a deep-learning based approach to multi-material decomposition trained with in-silico images that can overcome the limitations of conventional material decomposition approaches.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While CT scans can non-invasively diagnose and quantify emphysema, its consistency can be impacted by the variability in the patient's lung volume during the acquisition. Studies to evaluate and mitigate this variability requires imaging of patients under varying inspirations, which is ethically constrained due to possible radiation risk from repeated exposures. PURPOSE: To isolate and quantify the effects of lung volume variability on the consistency of CT-based emphysema measurements using a virtual imaging trial approach. METHODS: 20 human models with emphysema were created at varying inspirations (70% to 100% of full inspiration) emulating various lung volumes. The models were imaged using a scanner-specific simulator (DukeSim) to generate CT images. Emphysema biomarkers (LAA-950 and Perc15) and global lung density measures were computed from simulated CT images. A linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze the effect of lung volume and total lung volume (TLV) correction methods (physiological and statistical models) on the accuracy of these emphysema measures. RESULTS: The statistical analysis exhibited a marked influence of inspiration level on both LAA-950 and Perc15 (p-values < 0.001). LAA-950 underestimated the amount of emphysema by 1.44±0.32% (mean ± standard error) for every 1-liter deviation from full inspiration, and the log-log scale analysis revealed that Perc15 underestimated the severity by 1.16±0.02% for every 1% lower lung volume. These deviations were reduced by TLV correction methods. CONCLUSION: This study isolated the impact of lung volume variability on the consistency of emphysema quantification by eliminating the confounding factors inherent in clinical studies. Through controlled virtual imaging trial framework, we identified that the physiological model-based TLV correction method was more effective strategy compared to the statistical model for mitigating volume-dependent variability in emphysema assessment. Our study demonstrates an investigation that cannot be readily undertaken with human subjects or simplistic physical phantoms.",

Computational phantoms, which mimic real patient anatomy and physiology, play a central role in VITs. However, the current libraries of computational phantoms face limitations, particularly in terms of sample size and heterogeneity. Insufficient representation of the population hampers accurate assessment of imaging technologies across different patient groups. Traditionally, the more realistic computational phantoms were created by manual segmentation, which is a laborious and time-consuming task, impeding the expansion of phantom libraries. This study presents a framework for creating realistic computational phantoms using a suite of automatic segmentation models and performing three forms of automated quality control on the segmented organ masks. The result is the release of over 2500 new XCAT 3 generation of computational phantoms. This new formation embodies 140 structures and represents a comprehensive approach to detailed anatomical modeling. The developed computational phantoms are formatted in both voxelized and surface mesh formats. The framework is combined with an in-house CT scanner simulator to produce realistic CT images. The framework has the potential to advance virtual imaging trials, facilitating comprehensive and reliable evaluations of medical imaging technologies.

METHODS: We developed a VIT framework using Si-PCCT simulator and benchmarked it against a prototype using an ACR phantom for assessing spatial resolution and noise characteristics, and a geometric phantom for iodine quantification. We imaged geometrical phantoms (20 - 40 cm) with iodine concentrations ranging from 1 to 19.7 mg/ml and XCAT human models with iodine contrast at BMI of 19 to 38 kg/m2 across different radiation dose levels (13.9, 27.8, and 41.7 mGy of CTDIvol). We performed material decomposition, reconstructed iodine CT images, and evaluated iodine quantification accuracy. RESULTS: The Si-PCCT simulator closely matched with the prototype, with differences within 3 % in MTF (f50 and f10) and 3.7 % (fpeak) in NNPS, and Root-Mean-Square Error of 0.12 mg/ml in iodine quantification. The mean absolute errors (MAE) between the estimated and ground-truth iodine concentration were 0.10, 0.25, and 1.80 mg/ml for 20, 30, and 40 cm phantoms, and 0.31, 0.37, and 0.70 mg/ml for XCAT human models with BMIs of 19, 28, and 38 kg/m2, respectively. Similarly, the MAEs were 0.88, 0.45, and 0.31 mg/ml for the geometrical phantoms, and 0.66, 0.5, and 0.46 mg/ml for human models at CTDIvol of 13.9, 27.8, and 41.7 mGy respectively. These results demonstrate accurate iodine quantification performance, influenced by object size and radiation dose.

Computational phantoms play a crucial role in imaging research, supporting applications ranging from basic simulation studies to larger-scale virtual imaging trials (VITs). PURPOSE: In this work, we develop a population of detailed, anatomically variable 4D beating heart models for medical imaging research. METHODS: 32 sets of 4D CT data from the PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) national clinical trial served as the basis for the cardiac library. Each dataset was electrocardiogram-gated, containing 10 lower-resolution frames over the cardiac cycle and one high-resolution frame at mid-diastole. The 4D data for each patient was segmented using the AI-based Automatic Segmentation (AS) Cardio tool from Synopsys Simpleware. The segmented high-resolution frame was used to define the initial instance of the heart, each structure defined as a polygon mesh. The multi-channel Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (MC-LDDMM) image registration algorithm was then used to calculate the frame-to-frame motion of the heart from the low-resolution segmentations. The motion was applied to the cardiac model, creating a time-changing mesh model. Cubic spline curves were fit to the time-changing vertex locations, creating a 4D continuous model from which any number of time points can be generated. An example heart model was imported into a whole-body XCAT computational phantom and imaged with the DukeSim CT simulator for demonstration. RESULTS: Compared to reference values, the image-based cardiac models mimic the twisting, contracting motion of the heart for anatomically variable subjects. When combined with DukeSim, realistic virtual cardiac imaging data can be produced. CONCLUSIONS: 4D beating heart models were successfully created combining AI-based segmentation and image registration. The library of realistic cardiac models can be a vital tool for 4D cardiac imaging studies.",

Current guidelines recommend COPD diagnostic schemas that do not incorporate imaging abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a multidimensional COPD diagnostic schema that includes respiratory symptoms and computed tomographic imaging abnormalities identifies additional individuals with disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included 2 longitudinal cohorts: the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene), which enrolled 10 305 participants between November 9, 2007, and April 15, 2011, with longitudinal follow-up through August 31, 2022; and the Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD), which enrolled 1561 participants between November 26, 2009, and July 15, 2015, with follow-up through December 31, 2023. EXPOSURE: Exposure included the new multidimensional COPD diagnostic schema, defined by (1) major diagnostic category: presence of the major criterion (airflow obstruction based on postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV1]/forced vital capacity ratio <0.70) and at least 1 of 5 minor criteria (emphysema or bronchial wall thickening on computed tomography, dyspnea, poor respiratory quality of life, and chronic bronchitis); or (2) minor diagnostic category: presence of least 3 of 5 minor criteria (which must include emphysema and bronchial wall thickening for individuals with respiratory symptoms potentially due to other causes). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality, respiratory cause-specific mortality, exacerbations, and annualized change in FEV1. RESULTS: Among 9416 adults in COPDGene (mean [SD] age at enrollment, 59.6 [9.0] years; 5035 [53.5%] were men; 3071 [32.6%] were Black; 6345 (67.4%) were White; 4943 [52.5%] currently smoked), 811 of 5250 individuals (15.4%) without airflow obstruction were newly classified as having COPD by minor diagnostic category, and 282 of 4166 individuals (6.8%) with airflow obstruction were classified as not having COPD. Reclassified individuals with a new COPD diagnosis had greater all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.67-2.35; P < .001) and respiratory-specific mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.56-8.20; P = .003), more exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.79-2.44; P < .001), and more rapid FEV1 decline (adjusted β = -7.7 mL/y; 95% CI, -13.2 to -2.3; P = .006) compared with individuals classified as not having COPD. Among individuals with airflow obstruction on spirometry, those no longer classified as having COPD based on this new diagnostic schema had outcomes similar to those without airflow obstruction. Among 1341 adults in CanCOLD, individuals newly classified as having COPD experienced more exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.25-3.51; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A new COPD diagnostic schema integrating respiratory symptoms, respiratory quality of life, spirometry, and structural lung abnormalities on computed tomographic imaging newly classified some individuals as having COPD. These individuals had an increased risk of all-cause and respiratory-related death, frequent exacerbations, and rapid lung function decline compared with individuals classified as not having COPD. Some individuals with airflow obstruction without respiratory symptoms or evidence of structural lung disease were no longer classified as having COPD.",

                  "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Virtual imaging trials (VIT) have made significant advancements through the development of realistic human anatomy models, scanner-specific simulations, and virtual image interpretation. To promote VIT widespread adoption in the medical imaging community, it is important to develop methods that unify and facilitate the use of VITs, ensuring their reliable application across various imaging studies.  PURPOSE: We developed a containerized environment to enhance collaboration and interoperability across VIT platforms. This environment integrates key components of two well-established breast imaging platforms (OpenVCT and VICTRE), enabling direct comparison between specific modules for simulating anthropomorphic phantoms, lesions, and x-ray images.<h4>Methods</h4>Wrappers were developed to simplify the setup and execution of OpenVCT and VICTRE platforms and ensure compatibility and interoperability across different software components. These wrappers can streamline the installation of necessary packages, data formatting, and pipeline execution. The containerized environment was built using Docker images to provide resources for cross-platform integration. The breast anatomy generated by VICTRE was augmented using a simplex-based method from OpenVCT, providing additional texture modeling of breast parenchyma. Power spectra (PS) were calculated to assess the texture complexity of the simulated breast tissue and compare the outcomes. Lesion simulations were performed using breast models with calcifications and masses, allowing for a comparison of Monte Carlo (VICTRE) and raytracing (OpenVCT) imaging techniques. Key differences in x-ray attenuation models and image reconstruction methods were analyzed to evaluate the differences in the reconstructed images and overall image quality.<h4>Results</h4>The containerized approach simplified the setup and execution of the simulation platforms, embedding all the necessary packages and dependencies into the Docker images. These containerized environments supported the simulation of anthropomorphic breast models and x-ray images using both Monte Carlo (VICTRE) and raytracing (OpenVCT) methods. The breast images generated using the conventional VICTRE and the integrated simplex-based method from OpenVCT were visually comparable. The β$\\beta$ estimates from the PS for both approaches were close to 3, as expected for mammographic images, with only minor differences observed in the high-frequency components of the spectra (a difference of 0.2). These differences were particularly evident in areas of high tissue density and the regions of interest containing lesions; variations in the acquisition geometry affected the lesion visualization, demonstrating slight differences in the MC and raytracing simulations. Despite these differences, the overall performance of both methods in simulating images was similar, and the integrated environment provided a robust platform for comparing and optimizing imaging simulations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Containerized environments enable cross-platform comparisons and hybrid approaches. In this work, Docker images provided all the resources to simulate and compare the outcomes in breast phantom and x-ray image simulations, ensuring their robustness and reproducibility. The integration of VICTRE and OpenVCT methods allowed for data augmentation and provided resources for selection of imaging methods. The work lays a foundation for future VIT advancements, ensuring that these resources remain credible, reproducible, and accessible to the research community.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) is rapidly advancing with the recent FDA clearance of photon-counting CT (PCCT) systems for clinical use. New technologies are best evaluated using physical phantoms or patient images. However, both methods have their drawbacks: physical phantoms lack the complexity and diversity to be representative of a human population, and patient images lack the ground truth and are often cost- and time-prohibitive. Virtual imaging trials, also known as in silico trials, can mitigate these limitations by using computer simulations to conduct imaging experiments to assess the safety and efficacy of new medical technologies for specific clinical conditions. However, to date, there have been no simulation platforms to assess PCCT systems generalizable across clinical imaging conditions. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a computationally-efficient CT simulator that realistically accounts for conditions of a clinical PCCT system to be used for in silico trials. METHODS: The simulator was built upon a state-of-the-art platform (DukeSim) which simulates CT projection images of computational phantoms given the geometry and physics of the scanner and acquisition settings. To model the photon-counting detection process, we utilized a spatio-energetic detector model based on Monte Carlo simulations with known properties of the detectors. DukeSim was augmented to account for the geometry and physics of a clinical PCCT system (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens), including correlated noise between detector thresholds, and low-signal physics for photon starved regions. We validated the simulation platform against experimental measurements using two physical phantoms scanned with a clinical PCCT scanner. The ACR phantom-a cylindrical phantom with four inserts was used to validate the simulator across a clinically relevant dose range with images acquired at four dose levels (CTDIvol of 1.5-12.0 mGy). The Mercury phantom-a cylindrical phantom with five diameters (160-360 mm) was used to validate the simulator for a range of patient sizes. The experimental acquisitions were replicated using our developed simulation platform. Each acquisitions was reconstructed using ReconCT with three kernels at a 0.4 mm slice thickness. The real and simulated images were quantitatively compared in terms of image quality metrics. Further, the simulation spatial resolution uncertainty from input parameters was quantified in terms of the MTF. RESULTS: The developed simulator generated images that were close to the experimental scans. In terms of noise magnitude, the discrepancy between real and simulated data were 2.78 ± 3.02% and 2.67 ± 1.53%, for the ACR and Mercury phantom, respectively. In terms of the frequency at 50% MTF, the discrepancy between real and simulated data were 0.05 and 0.03 mm-1, for the ACR and Mercury phantom, respectively. Subsampling had a strong effect on the MTF measurement (  Δ E u c l i d e a n  d i s t a n c e  ${{\\Delta }_{Euclidean\\ distance}}$   = [0.25, 1.12]), while voxel size had a weaker effect (  Δ E u c l i d e a n  d i s t a n c e  ${{\\Delta }_{Euclidean\\ distance}}$   = [0.48, 0.55]). CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed and validated a virtual imaging platform for a current PCCT system, enabling the optimization of imaging parameters (including dose optimization) for specific clinical tasks, as well as comparisons across CT systems.",

METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of a prospective study, subjects underwent acquisitions using EICT and PCCT systems (August-December 2021) on the same day. PCCT projections were reconstructed with four kernels and two voxel sizes using 2024 reconstruction software (ReconCT, Siemens). PCCT and EICT data were compared using lung density measurements: percentage of low-attenuation areas <-950 HU (LAA-950), 15th percentile of lung density histogram (Perc15), and mean lung density (MLD). Measurement reproducibility and its relation to image quality parameters (modulation transfer function and noise) were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects (mean age, 67.4 years ± 9.6, 30 female) were studied. PCCT images had the closest agreement to EICT under identical voxel size and similar kernels, yielding lower LAA-950 (-0.9%±2.7, p < 0.05), higher Perc15 (1.4HU ± 7.9, p > 0.05), and higher MLD (2.4 HU ± 10.8, p > 0.05). At higher PCCT resolution (1024 × 1024 matrix, 0.2 mm slice thickness), the smoother quantitative kernel (Qr36) improved agreement, with differences of -0.5%±3.0, -0.1HU ± 9.8, and 2.8HU ± 11.1, for LAA-950, Perc15, and MLD (p > 0.05). Image quality parameters strongly correlated with density measurements (RPerc152=85.3%). CONCLUSIONS: PCCT yields reproducible lung density measurements comparable to EICT, with optimal reproducibility dependent on optimized reconstruction parameters and explainable by image quality parameters. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Lung density reproducibility is critical for integrating PCCT into EICT-based workflows. In our study, PCCT aligned more closely with EICT using similar kernels at identical voxel sizes, or smoother kernels at smaller voxel sizes.",

Virtual Imaging Trials (VITs) present a solution by simulating clinical trial components in a controlled, risk-free environment. The Virtual Lung Screening Trial (VLST), an in silico study inspired by the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), illustrates the potential of VITs to expedite clinical trials, minimize risks to participants, and promote optimal use of imaging technologies in healthcare. This study aimed to show that a virtual imaging trial platform could investigate some key elements of a major clinical trial, specifically the NLST, which compared Computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR) for lung cancer screening. With simulated cancerous lung nodules, a virtual patient cohort of 294 subjects was created using XCAT human models. Each virtual patient underwent both CT and CXR imaging, with deep learning models, the AI CT-Reader and AI CXR-Reader, acting as virtual readers to perform recall patients with suspicion of lung cancer. The primary outcome was the difference in diagnostic performance between CT and CXR, measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The AI CT-Reader showed superior diagnostic accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.95) compared to the AI CXR-Reader's AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.67-0.77). Furthermore, at the same 94% CT sensitivity reported by the NLST, the VLST specificity of 73% was similar to the NLST specificity of 73.4%. This CT performance highlights the potential of VITs to replicate certain aspects of clinical trials effectively, paving the way toward a safe and efficient method for advancing imaging-based diagnostics.",

PURPOSE: To provide an objective framework for evaluating CT reconstruction methods using virtual imaging resources consisting of a library of simulated CT projection images of a population of human models with various diseases. METHODS: Two hundred unique anthropomorphic, computational models were created with varied diseases consisting of 67 emphysema, 67 lung lesions, and 66 liver lesions. The organs were modeled based on clinical CT images of real patients. The emphysematous regions were modeled using segmentations from patient CT cases in the COPDGene Phase I dataset. For the lung and liver lesion cases, 1-6 malignant lesions were created and inserted into the human models, with lesion diameters ranging from 5.6 to 21.9 mm for lung lesions and 3.9 to 14.9 mm for liver lesions. The contrast defined between the liver lesions and liver parenchyma was 82 ± 12 HU, ranging from 50 to 110 HU. Similarly, the contrast between the lung lesions and the lung parenchyma was defined as 781 ± 11 HU, ranging from 725 to 805 HU. For the emphysematous regions, the defined HU values were -950 ± 17 HU ranging from -918 to -979 HU. The developed human models were imaged with a validated CT simulator. The resulting CT sinograms were shared with the participants. The participants reconstructed CT images from the sinograms and sent back their reconstructed images. The reconstructed images were then scored by comparing the results against the corresponding ground truth values. The scores included both task-generic (root mean square error [RMSE] and structural similarity matrix [SSIM]), and task-specific (detectability index [d'] and lesion volume accuracy) metrics. For the cases with multiple lesions, the measured metric was averaged across all the lesions. To combine the metrics with each other, each metric was normalized to a range of 0 to 1 per disease type, with \"0\" and \"1\" being the worst and best measured values across all cases of the disease type for all received reconstructions. RESULTS: The True-CT challenge attracted 52 participants, out of which 5 successfully completed the challenge and submitted the requested 200 reconstructions. Across all participants and disease types, SSIM absolute values ranged from 0.22 to 0.90, RMSE from 77.6 to 490.5 HU, d' from 0.1 to 64.6, and volume accuracy ranged from 1.2 to 753.1 mm3. The overall scores demonstrated that participant \"A\" had the best performance in all categories, except for the metrics of d' for lung lesions and RMSE for liver lesions. Participant \"A\" had an average normalized score of 0.41 ± 0.22, 0.48 ± 0.32, and 0.42 ± 0.33 for the emphysema, lung lesion, and liver lesion cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The True-CT challenge successfully enabled objective assessment of CT reconstructions with the unique advantage of access to a diverse population of diseased human models with known ground truth. This study highlights the significant potential of virtual imaging trials in objective assessment of medical imaging technologies.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Patient characteristics, iodine injection, and scanning parameters can impact the quality and consistency of contrast enhancement of hepatic parenchyma in CT imaging. Improving the consistency and adequacy of contrast enhancement can enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce clinical practice variability, with added positive implications for safety and cost-effectiveness in the use of contrast medium. We developed a clinical tool that uses patient attributes (height, weight, sex, age) to predict hepatic enhancement and suggest alternative injection/scanning parameters to optimize the procedure. METHODS: The tool was based on a previously validated neural network prediction model that suggested adjustments for patients with predicted insufficient enhancement. We conducted a prospective clinical study in which we tested this tool in 24 patients aiming for a target portal-venous parenchyma CT number of 110 HU ± 10 HU. RESULTS: Out of the 24 patients, 15 received adjustments to their iodine contrast injection parameters, resulting in median reductions of 8.8% in volume and 9.1% in injection rate. The scan delays were reduced by an average of 42.6%. We compared the results with the patients' previous scans and found that the tool improved consistency and reduced the number of underenhanced patients. The median enhancement remained relatively unchanged, but the number of underenhanced patients was reduced by half, and all previously overenhanced patients received enhancement reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the proposed patient-informed clinical framework can predict optimal contrast enhancement and suggest empiric injection/scanning parameters to achieve consistent and sufficient contrast enhancement of hepatic parenchyma. The described GUI-based tool can prospectively inform clinical decision-making predicting optimal patient's hepatic parenchyma contrast enhancement. This reduces instances of nondiagnostic/insufficient enhancement in patients.",

The successful application of digital twins in industries like nuclear energy, automotive engineering, and aviation underscores their potential in human health. METHODS: In April 2024, Duke University hosted the first international summit on Virtual Imaging Trials in Medicine (VITM).

The event featured plenary speakers, presentations, and panel discussions, emphasizing the integration of clinical and in-silico methods to enhance medical evaluations. RESULTS: Key takeaways included the necessity of diverse and realistic digital patient representations, the integration of physics and biology in simulations, and the development of robust validation frameworks. The summit also highlighted the importance of regulatory science and the establishment of Good Simulation Practices to ensure the credibility and reliability of virtual trials.

Due to the inter-effect of influencing CT parameters, traditional optimization methods rely on the testing of exhaustive combinations of these parameters. This poses a notable limitation due to the impracticality of exhaustive parameter testing. This study introduces a novel methodology leveraging Virtual Imaging Trials (VITs) and reinforcement learning to more efficiently optimize CT protocols. Computational phantoms with liver lesions were imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT reconstruction Toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage, tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The optimization process was done using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent which was trained to maximize the Detectability Index (d') of the liver lesion for each reconstructed image. Results showed that our reinforcement learning approach found the absolute maximum d' across the test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps compared to an exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a efficient and robust framework for CT protocol optimization. The flexibility of the proposed technique allows for use of varying image quality metrics as the objective metric to maximize for.

We developed human models at various stages of emphysema and bronchitis, informed by the COPDGene cohort. The specifications of a clinical CT scanner (Aquilion ONE Prism, Canon Medical Systems) were integrated into a CT simulator. This simulation framework was validated against experimental data. The analysis focused on the impact of tube current and kernel sharpness on two COPD biomarkers: LAA-950 (percentage of lung voxels with attenuation less than -950 HU) and Pi10 (the square root of the wall area around an airway with an internal perimeter of 10 mm) and mean absolute error (MAE; a voxel-wise error metric for emphysema density measurements). The increase in dose level showed minimal impact on the Pi10 measurements, but affected the LAA-950, with a reduction in variability observed at higher dose levels. Increasing kernel sharpness introduced variability in the LAA-950 and Pi10 measurements and higher MAE with sharper kernels. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that kernel sharpness contributed more to variability in the COPD biomarker measurements over time compared to dose level. Similarly, cross-sectional assessments showed that an increase in MAE, while a decrease in Pi10 measurement error with sharper kernels.

This study examines the impact of intra-scanner and inter-scanner variability on image quality and quantitative imaging tasks, with a focus on the detectability index (d') as a measure of patient-specific task performance. We evaluated 813 clinical phantom image sets from the COPDGene study, aggregated by CT scanner make, model, and acquisition and reconstruction protocol. Each phantom image set was assessed for image quality metrics, including the Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) and in-plane Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). The d' index was calculated for 12 hypothetical lesion detection tasks, emulating clinically relevant lung and liver lesions of varying sizes and contrast levels. Qualitatively, analysis showed intra-scanner variability in NPS and MTF curves measured for identical acquisition and reconstruction settings. Inter-scanner comparisons demonstrated variability in d' measurements across different scanner makes and models, of similar acquisition and reconstruction settings. The study showed an intra-scanner variability of up to 13.7% and an inter-scanner variability of up to 19.3% in the d' index. These findings emphasize the need for considering scanner variability in patient-centered care and indicate that CT technology may influence the reliability of imaging tasks.

The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of a VIT platform for harmonization across a range of lung imaging scenarios.

A physics-informed deep neural network was applied as the unified harmonization model for all three tasks. Evaluation results before and after harmonization reveal three findings: 1) modestly improved Dice scores and reduced Hausdorff Distances at 95th Percentile in lung structure segmentation; 2) decreased variation in biomarkers and radiomics features in COPD quantification; and 3) increased number of radiomics features with high intraclass correlation coefficient in lung nodule quantification.

Spiculations can be quantified using morphological radiomics features extracted from CT images. Radiomics features can be affected by the acquisition parameters and scanner technologies; thus, it is essential to identify imaging conditions that provide reliable measurements, particularly for emerging technologies like photon-counting CT (PCCT). This study aimed to systematically quantify the effect of imaging parameters on the radiomics measurements using a virtual imaging trial (VIT) platform, and further verify the findings with human clinical data.Approach.The VIT utilized nine virtual patients, each with three 6 mm nodules of varying spiculations. The virtual patients were run through a validated CT simulator (DukeSim) to acquire images at three dose levels (CTDIvol = 2.85, 5.69, and 11.38 mGy) with a clinical energy-integrating CT and a PCCT. The acquired projection images were reconstructed using multiple slice thicknesses, kernels, and matrix sizes. The reconstructed images were processed to extract morphological features using three segmentation methods. The features were clustered into three broad type categories. Features extracted from the acquired CT images were compared to their corresponding ground truth values, across all imaging conditions.Main results.Among all imaging conditions, slice thickness had the greatest effect on the radiomics measurements. When the thickest slices were used, the coefficient of variation increased by [1.19%-9.66%] in the energy integrating CT images, and [3.94%-24.43%] in the PCCT images. For both scanners, varying the kernel sharpness and dose affected the radiomics measurements insignificantly, while pixel size and segmentation method were observed to have stronger effects.

The purpose of this study was to assess how these methods complement one another in evaluating a system for clinical integration of an emerging technology, photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT), for thoracic imaging. METHODS: Four methods were used to assess a clinical PCCT system (NAEOTOM Alpha; Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany) across 3 reconstruction kernels (Br40f, Br48f, and Br56f). First, a phantom evaluation was performed using a computed tomography quality control phantom to characterize noise magnitude, spatial resolution, and detectability. Second, clinical images acquired using conventional and PCCT systems were used for a multi-institutional reader study where readers from 2 institutions were asked to rank their preference of images. Third, the clinical images were assessed in terms of in vivo image quality characterization of global noise index and detectability. Fourth, a virtual imaging trial was conducted using a validated simulation platform (DukeSim) that models PCCT and a virtual patient model (XCAT) with embedded lung lesions imaged under differing conditions of respiratory phase and positional displacement. Using known ground truth of the patient model, images were evaluated for quantitative biomarkers of lung intensity histograms and lesion morphology metrics. RESULTS: For the physical phantom study, the Br56f kernel was shown to have the highest resolution despite having the highest noise and lowest detectability. Readers across both institutions preferred the Br56f kernel (71% first rank) with a high interclass correlation (0.990). In vivo assessments found superior detectability for PCCT compared with conventional computed tomography but higher noise and reduced detectability with increased kernel sharpness. For the virtual imaging trial, Br40f was shown to have the best performance for histogram measures, whereas Br56f was shown to have the most precise and accurate morphology metrics. CONCLUSION: The 4 evaluation methods each have their strengths and limitations and bring complementary insight to the evaluation of PCCT. Although no method offers a complete answer, concordant findings between methods offer affirmatory confidence in a decision, whereas discordant ones offer insight for added perspective. Aggregating our findings, we concluded the Br56f kernel best for high-resolution tasks and Br40f for contrast-dependent tasks.",

Purpose To compare simulated photon-counting CT (PCCT) with energy-integrating detector (EID) CT for the detection of small liver lesions. Materials and Methods In this reader study (July to December 2023), a virtual imaging framework was used with 50 anthropomorphic phantoms and 183 generated liver lesions (one to six lesions per phantom, 0.4-1.5 cm in diameter). Virtual CT platforms simulated PCCT and EID CT scanners. Phantoms were virtually scanned using routine (6 mGy) and low-dose (1.5 mGy) conditions and reconstructed with three kernels. A subset of 300 scans (150 PCCT vs EID CT pairs) were selected. Four radiologists independently reviewed all scans to mark liver lesions, assigned confidence scores for detection, and rated scan quality. Analysis was performed on a per-lesion basis to determine sensitivity for several variables and on a per-scan basis for scan quality. The McNemar test, two-sided paired t tests, and mixed-effects logistic regression models were fitted; P < .05 was considered indicative of statistically significant difference. Results Consensus reader sensitivity in detecting lesions was 82.1% (451 of 549) for PCCT versus 77.6% (426 of 549) for EID CT (P < .001), with a mean sensitivity gain of 4.3 percentage points ± 1.3 (P < .001 to P = .02 per reader). Readers had better subjective confidence for lesions at PCCT (mean score, 61.5 ± 22 vs 56.1 ± 24 [on a 101-point scale]; P < .001). Sensitivity was lower for lesions smaller than 1 cm, with more pronounced difference between PCCT and EID CT (74.0% [271 of 366] vs 67.2% [246 of 366]; P < .001). At the lower dose level, PCCT showed higher sensitivity than EID CT (68.9% [168 of 244] vs 61.1% [149 of 244]; P < .001) for subcentimeter lesions. In a multivariable model, PCCT was independently associated with increased odds of lesion detection (odds ratio, 1.55; P < .001). Image quality was slightly higher for PCCT (mean score, 55.3 vs 50.6 [on a 101-point scale]; P < .001). Conclusion Compared with EID CT, PCCT showed better sensitivity in the detection of small liver lesions. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) remains the gold standard for areal bone mineral density (aBMD) assessment but is underutilized, with many at-risk individuals not undergoing screening. Photon-counting CT (PCCT) spectral localizer radiographs (LRs) offer a promising alternative for opportunistic osteoporosis screening by leveraging material decomposition to estimate areal BMD (aBMD) with a low radiation dose comparable to DEXA. This study evaluates the accuracy of PCCT spectral LRs for aBMD assessment through a combination of physical phantom experiments and virtual imaging human trials (VITs). Using a custom material decomposition algorithm, hydroxyapatite and water maps were generated from dual-energy spectral LRs to compute aBMD. Phantom measurements demonstrated strong agreement between PCCT-derived aBMD and DEXA values, with percentage differences ranging from 1.7% to 4.1%. VITs further optimized imaging parameters by varying mAs levels, revealing a reduction in mean absolute error from 0.2023 g/cm<sup>2</sup> at 35 mAs to 0.0863 g/cm<sup>2</sup> at 160 mAs, indicating improved measurement precision at higher exposure settings. These findings support the feasibility of PCCT spectral LRs for accurate, low-dose osteoporosis screening, potentially enabling early detection and reducing fracture-related healthcare burdens.",

That is so despite the tube current modulation (TCM) systems adjusting radiation exposure according to patient body habitus to achieve consistent image quality. We conducted a Virtual Imaging Trial (VIT) to identify possible causes of this variability by repeated scanning of patients in different positions, a prospect that is ethically infeasible in real practice. Three anthropomorphic computational (XCAT) phantoms with different BMIs (24.4, 28.5, and 32.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were imaged with an established VIT platform (DukeSim), using a clinical chest-abdomen protocol. XCAT phantoms were imaged at the isocenter with arms above the head and alongside the trunk. In addition, each phantom with arms up was imaged following vertical shifts (-80, -40, -20 mm; +40 mm). CTDIvol, tissue global noise index (GNI), organ noise (aorta and liver), and water equivalent diameter (WED) were evaluated and compared to the standard position values. Across all the positions with respect to the isocenter, the maximum percentage differences for patients 1, 2, and 3 were respectively 0.8%, 2.0%, and 2.3% for CTDIvol; 13.1%, 8.4%, and 6.0% for GNI; 24.2%, 11.5%, -5.7% for aorta noise, and 12.1%, 11.0%, 7.4% for liver noise.

This work used metrologies specific to spectral CT to evaluate the impact of acquisition conditions on the quality of spectral CT images and accuracy of material decomposition techniques.Approach.Computational phantoms were created with cylindrical shapes and variable sizes (20-40 cm), containing inserts of iodine and gadolinium (1-8 mg ml-1). The phantoms were imaged using a validated CT simulator modeling a clinical photon-counting CT scanner. The acquisitions were done at different detector energy thresholds (50-90 keV) and tube currents (25-250 mAs). The images were used to develop and train a data-driven material identification and quantification algorithm. Two spectral metrologies, multivariate contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and separability index, were used to characterize the impact of energy threshold, tube current, phantom size, and material concentration on signal quality. The results were interpreted in terms of figures of merit of accuracy for classification and mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for regression.Main results. Signal quality for iodine and gadolinium was maximized with a low energy threshold, high tube current, and small phantom size. While conventional CNR terms predicted variable image quality for two-thirds of all conditions, multivariate CNR was above 10 for half of those. Separability index showed that for a phantom size greater than 30 cm, a minimum of 75-110 mAs is required to separate 2 mg ml-1of iodine and gadolinium. For both classification and regression tasks, a random forest model with a local statistics dataset provided the best performance. Across conditions, classification performance was 0.66-0.99 for I accuracy, 0.72-0.99 for Gd accuracy. Regression performance was 0.02-0.91 mg ml-1I and 0.02-0.59 mg ml-1Gd for MAE and 0.11-1.08 mg ml-1I and 0.07-0.76 mg ml-1Gd for RMSE.Significance.Multivariate CNR and separability index metrologies can predict material decomposition performance. Theses metrics demonstrated that the decomposition of iodine and gadolinium have higher separability when the acquisition is done at a lower energy threshold, with a higher tube current, and when the imaged object has a smaller size. Object size had the largest impact on metrics and decomposition performance.",

The latter, directly related to effective diagnosis, can be associated to clinical risk. While many strategies have been developed to ascertain radiation risk, there has been a paucity of studies assessing clinical risk, thus limiting the optimization reach to achieve a minimum total risk to patients undergoing imaging examinations. In this study, we developed a mathematical framework for an imaging procedure total risk index considering both radiation and clinical risks based on specific tasks and investigated diseases. METHODS: The proposed model characterized total risk as the sum of radiation and clinical risks defined as functions of radiation burden, disease prevalence, false-positive rate, expected life-expectancy loss for misdiagnosis, and radiologist interpretative performance (i.e., AUC). The proposed total risk model was applied to a population of one million cases simulating a liver cancer scenario. RESULTS: For all demographics, the clinical risk outweighs radiation risk by at least 400%. The optimization application indicates that optimizing typical abdominal CT exams should involve a radiation dose increase in over 90% of the cases, with the highest risk optimization potential in Asian population (24% total risk reduction; 306%  C T D I v o l   increase) and lowest in Hispanic population (5% total risk reduction; 89%  C T D I v o l   increase). CONCLUSIONS: Framing risk-to-benefit assessment as a risk-versus-risk question, calculating both clinical and radiation risk using comparable units, allows a quantitative optimization of total risks in CT. The results highlight the dominance of clinical risk at typical CT examination dose levels, and that exaggerated dose reductions can even harm patients.",

To tackle these issues, virtual trials (aka in silico trials) have emerged as a promising alternative, using computational models of human subjects and imaging devices, and observer models/analysis to carry out experiments. To facilitate the widespread use of virtual trials within the medical imaging research community, a major need is to establish a common consensus framework that all can use. Based on the ongoing efforts of an AAPM Task Group (TG387), this article provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for establishing virtual imaging trial frameworks, paving the way toward their widespread use within the medical imaging research community. These requirements include credibility, reproducibility, and accessibility. Credibility assessment involves verification, validation, uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis, ensuring the accuracy and realism of computational models. A proper credibility assessment requires a clear context of use and the questions that the study is intended to objectively answer. For reproducibility and accessibility, this article highlights the need for detailed documentation, user-friendly software packages, and standard input/output formats. Challenges in data and software sharing, including proprietary data and inconsistent file formats, are discussed. Recommended solutions to enhance accessibility include containerized environments and data-sharing hubs, along with following standards such as CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium).

However, the diagnostic performance of DCR is uncertain owing to an insufficient number of clinical cases. One solution is virtual imaging trials (VITs), which is an emerging alternative method for efficiently evaluating medical imaging technology via computer simulation techniques. PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the typical threshold thickness of residual normal tissue below which the presence of emphysema may be detected by DCR via VITs using virtual patients with different physiques and a user-defined ground truth. METHODS: Twenty extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantoms that exhibited changes in lung density during respiration were generated to simulate virtual patients. To simulate a locally collapsed lung, an air sphere was inserted into each lung regions in the phantom. The XCAT phantom was virtually projected using an x-ray simulator. The respiratory changes in pixel value (ΔPV) were measured on the projected air spheres (simulated lesions) to calculate the percentage of decrease (ΔPV%) relative to ΔPVexp-ins in the absence of an air sphere. The relationship between the amount of residual normal tissue and ΔPV% was fitted to a cubic approximation curve (hereafter, performance curve), and the threshold at which the ΔPV% began to decrease (normal-tissuethre) was determined. The goodness of fit for each performance curve was evaluated according to the coefficient of determination (R2) and the 95% confidence interval derived from the standard errors between the measured and theoretical values corresponding to each performance curve. The ΔPV% was also visualized as a color scaling to validate the results of the VITs in both virtual and clinical patients. RESULTS: For each lung region in all body sizes, the ΔPV% decreased as the amount of residual normal tissue decreased and could be defined as a function of the amount of residual normal tissue in front of and behind the simulated lesions with high R2 values. Meanwhile, the difference between the measured and theoretical values corresponding to each performance curve was only partially included in the 95% confidence interval. The normal-tissuethre values were 146.0, 179.5, and 170.9 mm for the upper, middle, and lower lungs, respectively, which were demonstrated in virtual patients and one real patient, where the value of the residual normal tissue was less than that of normal-tissuethre; any reduction in the residual normal tissue was reflected as a reduced ΔPV and depicted as a reduced color intensity. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of DCR-based pulmonary impairment assessment depends on the amount of residual normal tissue in front of and behind the lesion rather than on the lesion size. The performance curve can be defined as a function of the amount of residual normal tissue in each lung region with a specific threshold of normal tissue remaining where lesions become detectable, shown as a decrease in ΔPV. The results of VITs are expected to accelerate future clinical trials for DCR-based pulmonary function assessment.",

We objectively compare PCCT to EICT for liver lesion detection. APPROACH: Fifty anthropomorphic, computational phantoms with inserted liver lesions were generated. Contrast-enhanced scans of each phantom were simulated at the portal venous phase. The acquisitions were done using DukeSim, a validated CT simulation platform. Scans were simulated at two dose levels (   CTDI vol    1.5 to 6.0 mGy) modeling PCCT (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and EICT (SOMATOM Flash, Siemens). Images were reconstructed with varying levels of kernel sharpness (soft, medium, sharp). To provide a quantitative estimate of image quality, the modulation transfer function (MTF), frequency at 50% of the MTF (  f 50   ), noise magnitude, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR, per lesion), and detectability index (   d '    , per lesion) were measured. RESULTS: Across all studied conditions, the best detection performance, measured by   d '    , was for PCCT images with the highest dose level and softest kernel. With soft kernel reconstruction, PCCT demonstrated improved lesion CNR and   d '    compared with EICT, with a mean increase in CNR of 35.0% ( p < 0.001  ) and 21% ( p < 0.001  ) and a mean increase in   d '    of 41.0% ( p < 0.001  ) and 23.3% ( p = 0.007  ) for the 1.5 and 6.0 mGy acquisitions, respectively. The improvements were greatest for larger phantoms, low-contrast lesions, and low-dose scans. CONCLUSIONS: PCCT demonstrated objective improvement in liver lesion detection and image quality metrics compared with EICT. These advances may lead to earlier and more accurate liver lesion detection, thus improving patient care.",

PURPOSE: To systematically assess the performance of a clinical PCCT scanner for lung density quantifications and compare it against EICT. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved a retrospective analysis of subjects scanned (August-December 2021) using a clinical PCCT system. The influence of altering reconstruction parameters was studied (reconstruction kernel, pixel size, slice thickness). A virtual CT dataset of anthropomorphic virtual subjects was acquired to demonstrate the correspondence of findings to clinical dataset, and to perform systematic imaging experiments, not possible using human subjects. The virtual subjects were imaged using a validated, scanner-specific CT simulator of a PCCT and two EICT (defined as EICT A and B) scanners. The images were evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) of lung and emphysema density against their corresponding ground truth. RESULTS: Clinical and virtual PCCT datasets showed similar trends, with sharper kernels and smaller voxel sizes increasing percentage of low-attenuation areas below -950 HU (LAA-950) by up to 15.7 ± 6.9% and 11.8 ± 5.5%, respectively. Under the conditions studied, higher doses, thinner slices, smaller pixel sizes, iterative reconstructions, and quantitative kernels with medium sharpness resulted in lower lung MAE values. While using these settings for PCCT, changes in the dose level (13 to 1.3 mGy), slice thickness (0.4 to 1.5 mm), pixel size (0.49 to 0.98 mm), reconstruction technique (70 keV-VMI to wFBP), and kernel (Qr48 to Qr60) increased lung MAE by 15.3 ± 2.0, 1.4 ± 0.6, 2.2 ± 0.3, 4.2 ± 0.8, and 9.1 ± 1.6 HU, respectively. At the optimum settings identified per scanner, PCCT images exhibited lower lung and emphysema MAE than those of EICT scanners (by 2.6 ± 1.0 and 9.6 ± 3.4 HU, compared to EICT A, and by 4.8 ± 0.8 and 7.4 ± 2.3 HU, compared to EICT B). The accuracy of lung density measurements was correlated with subjects' mean lung density (p < 0.05), measured by PCCT at optimum setting under the conditions studied. CONCLUSION: Photon-counting CT demonstrated superior performance in density quantifications, with its influences of imaging parameters in line with energy-integrating CT scanners. The technology offers improvement in lung quantifications, thus demonstrating potential toward more objective assessment of respiratory conditions.",

Among cardiovascular diseases, coronary artery disease (CAD) is a key contributor, and it is the attributed cause of death for 10% of all deaths annually. The prevalence of CAD is commensurate with the rise in new medical imaging technologies intended to aid in its diagnosis and treatment. The necessary clinical trials required to validate and optimize these technologies require a large cohort of carefully controlled patients, considerable time to complete, and can be prohibitively expensive. A safer, faster, less expensive alternative is using virtual imaging trials (VITs), utilizing virtual patients or phantoms combined with accurate computer models of imaging devices. PURPOSE: In this work, we develop realistic, physiologically-informed models for coronary plaques for application in cardiac imaging VITs. METHODS: Histology images of plaques at micron-level resolution were used to train a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DC-GAN) to create a library of anatomically variable plaque models with clinical anatomical realism. The stability of each plaque was evaluated by finite element analysis (FEA) in which plaque components and vessels were meshed as volumes, modeled as specialized tissues, and subjected to the range of normal coronary blood pressures. To demonstrate the utility of the plaque models, we combined them with the whole-body XCAT computational phantom to perform initial simulations comparing standard energy-integrating detector (EID) CT with photon-counting detector (PCD) CT. RESULTS: Our results show the network is capable of generating realistic, anatomically variable plaques. Our simulation results provide an initial demonstration of the utility of the generated plaque models as targets to compare different imaging devices. CONCLUSIONS: Vast, realistic, and variable CAD pathologies can be generated to incorporate into computational phantoms for VITs. There they can serve as a known truth from which to optimize and evaluate cardiac imaging technologies quantitatively.",

To ensure that clinically irrelevant changes do not reduce sensitivity to capture the radiomics changes between successive acquisitions, it is essential to determine the optimal imaging systems and protocols to use. PURPOSE: The main goal of our study was to optimize CT protocols and minimize the minimum detectable difference (MDD) in successive acquisitions of MRFs. METHOD: MDDs were derived based on the previous research involving 15 realizations of nodule models at two different sizes. Our study involved simulations of two consecutive acquisitions using 297 different imaging conditions, representing variations in scanners' reconstruction kernels, dose levels, and slice thicknesses. Parametric polynomial models were developed to establish correlations between imaging system characteristics, lesion size, and MDDs. Additionally, polynomial models were used to model the correlation of the imaging system parameters. Optimization problems were formulated for each MRF to minimize the approximated function. Feature importance was determined for each MRF through permutation feature analysis. The proposed method was compared to the recommended guidelines by the quantitative imaging biomarkers alliance (QIBA). RESULTS: The feature importance analysis showed that lesion size is the most influential parameter to estimate the MDDs in most of the MRFs. Our study revealed that thinner slices and higher doses had a measurable impact on reducing the MDDs. Higher spatial resolution and lower noise magnitude were identified as the most suitable or noninferior acquisition settings. Compared to QIBA, the proposed protocol selection guideline demonstrated a reduced coefficient of variation, with values decreasing from 1.49 to 1.11 for large lesions and from 1.68 to 1.12 for small lesions. CONCLUSION: The protocol optimization framework provides means to assess and optimize protocols to minimize the MDD to increase the sensitivity of the measurements in lung cancer screening.",

PURPOSE: To comprehensively compare task-generic image quality of photon-counting CT (PCCT) and energy integrating CT (EICT) systems as a function of phantom size, dose, and reconstruction kernel. METHODS: A size-variant phantom (Mercury Phantom 3.0) was used to characterize the image quality of PCCT and EICT systems as a function of object size. The phantom contained five cylinders attached by slanted tapered sections. Each cylinder contained two sections: one uniform for noise, and the other with inserts for spatial resolution and contrast measurements. The phantom was scanned on Siemens' SOMATOM Force and NAEOTOM Alpha at 1.18 and 7.51 mGy without tube current modulation. CTDIvol was matched across two systems by setting the required tube currents, else, all other acquisition settings were fixed. CT sinograms were reconstructed using FBP and iterative (ADMIRE2 - Force; QIR2 - Alpha) algorithms with Body regular (Br) kernels. Noise Power Spectrum (NPS), Task Transfer Function (TTF), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and detectability index (d') for a task of identifying 2-mm disk were evaluated based on AAPM TG-233 metrology using imQuest, an open-source software package. Averaged noise frequency (fav ) and 50% cut-off frequency for TTF (f50 ) were used as scalar metrics to quantify noise texture and spatial resolution, respectively. The difference between image quality metrics' measurements was calculated as IQPCCT - IQEICT . RESULTS: From Br40 (soft) to Br64 (sharp), f50 for air insert increased from 0.35 mm-1  ± 0.04 (standard deviation) to 0.76 mm-1  ± 0.17, 0.34 mm-1  ± 0.04 to 0.77 mm-1  ± 0.17, 0.37 mm-1  ± 0.02 to 0.95 mm-1  ± 0.17 for PCCT-T3D-QIR2, PCCT-70keV-QIR2, and EICT-ADMIRE2, respectively, when averaged over all sizes and dose levels. Similarly, from Br40 to Br64, noise magnitude increased from 10.86 HU ± 7.12 to 38.61 HU ± 18.84, 10.94 HU ± 7.08 to 38.82 HU ± 18.70, 13.74 HU ± 11.02 to 52.11 HU ± 26.22 for PCCT-T3D-QIR2, PCCT-70keV-QIR2, and EICT-ADMIRE2, respectively. The difference in fav was consistent across all sizes and dose levels. PCCT-70keV-VMI showed better consistency in contrast measurements for iodine and bone inserts than PCCT-T3D and EICT; however, PCCT-T3D had higher contrast for both inserts. From Br40 to Br64, considering all sizes and dose levels, CNR for iodine insert decreased from 52.30 ± 46.44 to 12.18 ± 10.07, 40.42 ± 33.42 to 9.48 ± 7.16, 39.94 ± 37.60 to 7.84 ± 6.67 for PCCT-T3D-QIR2, PCCT-70keV-QIR2, and EICT-ADMIRE2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both PCCT image types, T3D and 70-keV-VMI exhibited similar or better noise, contrast, CNR than EICT when comparing kernels with similar names. For 512 × 512 matrix, PCCT's sharp kernels had lower resolution than EICT's sharp kernels. For all image quality metrics, except extreme low, every dose condition had a similar set of IQ-matching kernels. It suggests that considering patient size and dose level to determine IQ-matching kernel pairs across PCCT and EICT systems may not be imperative while translating protocols, except when the signal to the detector is extremely low.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anthropomorphic, computational models were developed for lungs, liver, inner ear, and head-and-neck (H&N) anatomies. These regions included specific abnormalities such as lesions in the lungs and liver, and calcified plaques in the carotid arteries. The anatomical models were imaged using a scanner-specific CT simulation platform (DukeSim) modeling a Si-PCCT prototype and a conventional ECT system at matched dose levels. The simulated polychromatic projections were reconstructed with matched in-plane resolutions using manufacturer-specific software. The reconstructed pairs of images were scored by radiologists to gauge the task-specific perceptual benefits provided by Si-PCCT compared to ECT based on visualization of anatomical and image quality features. The scores were standardized as z-scores for minimizing inter-observer variability and compared between the systems for evidence of statistically significant improvement (one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a significance level of 0.05) in perceptual performance for Si-PCCT. RESULTS: Si-PCCT offered favorable image quality and improved visualization capabilities, leading to mean improvements in task-specific perceptual performance over ECT for most tasks. The improvements for Si-PCCT were statistically significant for the visualization of lung lesion (0.08 ± 0.89 vs. 0.90 ± 0.48), liver lesion (-0.64 ± 0.37 vs. 0.95 ± 0.55), and soft tissue structures (-0.47 ± 0.90 vs. 0.33 ± 1.24) and cochlea (-0.47 ± 0.80 vs. 0.38 ± 0.62) in inner ear. CONCLUSIONS: Si-PCCT exhibited mean improvements in task-specific perceptual performance over ECT for most clinical tasks considered in this study, with statistically significant improvement for 6/20 tasks. The perceptual performance of Si-PCCT is expected to improve further with availability of spectral information and reconstruction kernels optimized for high resolution provided by smaller pixel size of Si-PCCT. The outcomes of this study indicate the positive potential of Si-PCCT for benefiting routine clinical practice through improved image quality and visualization capabilities.",

Although PRM-derived measurements have been shown to predict disease severity and phenotyping, their quantitative accuracy is impacted by the variability of scanner settings and patient conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variability of PRM-based measurements due to the changes in the scanner types and configurations. We developed 10 human chest models with emphysema and air-trapping at end-inspiration and end-expiration states. These models were virtually imaged using a scanner-specific CT simulator (DukeSim) to create CT images at different acquisition settings for energy-integrating and photon-counting CT systems. The CT images were used to estimate PRM maps. The quantified measurements were compared with ground truth values to evaluate the deviations in the measurements. Results showed that PRM measurements varied with scanner type and configurations. The emphysema volume was overestimated by 3 ± 9.5 % (mean ± standard deviation) of the lung volume, and the functional small airway disease (fSAD) volume was underestimated by 7.5±19 % of the lung volume. PRM measurements were more accurate and precise when the acquired settings were photon-counting CT, higher dose, smoother kernel, and larger pixel size.

This task, possible using quantitative CT, is particularly challenging as scanner and patient attributes change over time, negatively impacting the CT-derived quantitative measures. Efforts to minimize such variations have been limited by the absence of ground truth in clinical data, thus necessitating reliance on clinical surrogates, which may not have one-to-one correspondence to CT-based findings. This study aimed to develop the first suite of human models with emphysema at multiple time points, enabling longitudinal assessment of disease progression with access to ground truth. A total of 14 virtual subjects were modeled across three time points. Each human model was virtually imaged using a validated imaging simulator (DukeSim), modeling an energy-integrating CT scanner. The models were scanned at two dose levels and reconstructed with two reconstruction kernels, slice thicknesses, and pixel sizes. The developed longitudinal models were further utilized to demonstrate utility in algorithm testing and development. Two previously developed image processing algorithms (CT-HARMONICA, EmphysemaSeg) were evaluated. The results demonstrated the efficacy of both algorithms in improving the accuracy and precision of longitudinal quantifications, from 6.1±6.3% to 1.1±1.1% and 1.6±2.2% across years 0-5. Further investigation in EmphysemaSeg identified that baseline emphysema severity, defined as >5% emphysema at year 0, contributed to its reduced performance. This finding highlights the value of virtual imaging trials in enhancing the explainability of algorithms. Overall, the developed longitudinal human models enabled ground-truth based assessment of image processing algorithms for lung quantifications.",

These traditional trials tend to be sluggish, costly, and frequently deficient in definitive evidence, all the while subjecting participants to ionizing radiation. Our VIT platform meticulously mimics essential components of the imaging process, encompassing everything from virtual patients and scanners to simulated readers. Within the scope of this intended research, we aim to authenticate our virtual imaging trial platform by duplicating the results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) for lung cancer screening through the emulation of low-dose computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR) procedures. The methodology involves creating 66 unique computational phantoms, each with inserted simulated lung nodules. Replicating NLST CT imaging via Duke Legacy W20 scanner matched essential properties. Virtual imaging was done through DukeSim. A LUNA16-trained virtual reader, combining a 3D RetinaNet model (front-end) with a ResNet-10 false positive reduction model (back-end), evaluated the virtually imaged data, ensuring rigorous assessment. The back-end model achieved a sensitivity of over 95% at fewer than 3 false positives per scan for both the clinical and virtual imaged CTs. Notably, nodule diameter-based analysis showcases even higher sensitivity for nodules measuring 10 mm or more. In conclusion, the integration of diverse computational and imaging techniques, culminating in a virtual reader, demonstrates promising sensitivity. To capture both arms of the trial, future research will compare virtual reader performance on CT with CXR. This affirms the transformative potential of virtual imaging trials in advancing evidence-based medicine, offering an efficient and ethically conscious approach to medical research and development.",

The purpose of this study was to create hybrid lesion models and associated tool incorporating morphological and textural realism. The developed tool creates a lesion morphology based on input parameters describing its shape and spiculation. Internal heterogeneity is added as 3D clustered lumpy background (CLB), allowing for various sub-classes of lesions including full solid, semi-solid, and ground-glass lesions. To insert a lesion into a full body human model (e.g., XCAT phantom), the edges of the lesion are blended into the surrounding background using a parameterizable Gaussian blurring technique. The developed lesion tool allows users to define lesion sizes either manually or automatically following population distribution of lesion sizes. Similarly, the tool allows users to insert lesions either manually or automatically while avoiding intersections with pulmonary structures. The utility of the developed lesion tool was demonstrated by modeling both homogeneous and heterogeneous lung lesions and inserting them into 5 human models (XCAT). The human models were imaged using a validated CT simulator (DukeSim). Images of heterogeneous lesions were visually comparable to clinical images. The first order and texture radiomics features (58 features) were extracted from all image series and compared using the Pearson correlation. The two lesion generation techniques for full solid lesions (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) were observed to have a weak correlation (r < 0.4) for 35 of 58 features using a soft kernel, and for 43 of 58 features using a sharp kernel-capturing the structural differences between the two models. The lesion tool proved capable of forming different lung lesion sub-classes (full-solid, semi-solid, and ground-glass) through its input parameters to emulate the lesion characteristics of interest for a virtual lesion study.",

The need for lung segmentation techniques for sequential chest images is growing. Thus, this study was aimed at developing a deep learning-based lung segmentation technique for DCR across all age groups using virtual patient images. DCR images of 53 patients (M:F = 34:19, age: 1-88 years, median age: 63 years) were used. Owing to the difficulty in collecting a large dataset of pediatric DCR images, the 4D extended cardiac-torso phantom (XCAT phantom) was used to augment the pediatric data. A total of ten pediatric XCAT phantoms (five males and females each, age: 0-15 years) of virtual patients were generated and projected. Two deep-learning models, U-net and DeepLabv3 using MobileNetv3 as the backbone, were implemented. They were trained to estimate the lung segmentation masks using DCR image datasets consisting of only real or a mixture of real and virtual patients. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and intersection over union (IoU) were used as evaluation metrics. When trained only on real patients, for both the metrics, DeepLabv3 (DSC/IoU: 0.902/0.822) exhibited higher values than U-net (DSC/IoU: 0.791/0.673). When trained on dataset of a mixture of real and virtual patients, values of both the metrics improved in both models (DSC/IoU: 0.906/0.828 and 0.795/0.677 for DeepLabv3 and U-net, respectively). These results indicate that the developed model, that is, the combination of DeepLabv3 and XCAT-based augmentation methods, is effective for the lung segmentation of DCR images of various respiratory phases for all age groups.",

                  "abstract": "The measurements of bone macro- and microstructures provide major insight into bone health and risk fracture. The accuracy of these measurements is limited when Conventional CT is used. However, CT technology has advanced with the introduction of photon-counting detectors that offer significant improvements in spatial resolution. This advancement offers potential improvements in resolving trabecular microstructures, and the quantification of bone through current or emerging biomarkers. Additionally, the spectral separation available in photon-counting CT (PCCT) may further aid in quantification. The purpose of this study was to objectively investigate PCCT capabilities in accurate quantification of bone macro- and micro-structures. To do so, 5 human bone specimens were scanned using a PCCT scanner (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens) and an energy-integrating CT (EICT) (FORCE, Siemens). Each specimen was imaged at a CTDI<inf>vol</inf> of 4 and 8mGy, and then reconstructed with 2 matrix sizes and at least 2 kernels. For PCCT, a 70 keV virtual mono-energetic image series was acquired to evaluate the potential benefits of spectral maps. The same specimens were also scanned using a high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT to provide a ground truth for the bone metrics. Each image series was analyzed in terms of bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone volume to total bone volume. PCCT demonstrated major improvements (5.5% compared to 17% error for EICT) in quantifying bone microstructures (BV/TV). However, the BMD measurements remained similar across imaging conditions and scanners, and did not significantly change by the PCCT spatial resolution enhancement. For BV/TV measurements, PCCT T3D was the most accurate when the sharpest kernel available and 1024-matrix size for (error: 5.53% ± 4.72%) were used. Similarly, EICT images were the most accurate for BV/TV measurements (error: 16.70% ± 10.55%) when a medium-sharpness kernel and 1024-matrix size were used. The overall results suggest that PCCT technology can further improve trabecular bone measurements and thus enhance the clinical decision making for patients with bone disease.",

                  "abstract": "Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is an emerging x-ray spectral imaging technology. There are several PCCT prototypes available for clinical and experimental applications. Despite many published results, objective quantitative evaluation of PCCT systems remains challenging due to varied and unknown influences. In addition, CT acquisition geometry and image processing mechanisms are often proprietary, complicating the correlations between the detector's physical characteristics and the corresponding CT image quality, hindering fair comparisons between different technologies. This study aimed to provide a resource to address these challenges by developing a versatile model that accurately replicates the physics of any semiconductor-based photon-counting detector (PCD) and integrating it into a virtual imaging framework to generate detector-specific CT images. The methodology involved a Monte Carlo simulation to model x-ray photon interactions with PCDs and an analytical Gaussian charge sharing model to model charge-diffusion and -repulsion in the detector. Finally, the energy deposited post-crosstalk by source photons (1-120 keV) in the 3×3-pixel-neighborhood was translated into photon counts across two energy thresholds to compute detector-specific spatio-energetic covariance correlation matrices. This framework was validated against experimental measurements of a clinical CdTe-based PCCT, showcasing its accuracy in reproducing real-world scenarios. Additionally, to demonstrate the model's efficacy, we simulated key PCD materials (Si, CdTe, CZT) and designed standardized scanner components, developing virtual systems (DukeCounter scanners). These systems were used to “scan” a physics phantom (ACR) and anthropomorphic-computational models (XCAT). In low-energy (i.e., 5 keV for Si, 20 keV for CdTe and CZT) threshold images, for 125 mAs acquisitions, (noise magnitudes, HU for bone insert) measured in ACR phantom were (76.0 HU, 889.4 HU), (76.9 HU, 932.9 HU), (81.7 HU, 939.4 HU), and the percent difference in Pi10 (airway-based biomarker) between the ground-truth and CT images of XCAT phantoms were 33.7%±3.6%, 22.6%±15.2%, 33.0%±3.6% for CdTe-, CZT-, Si-based DukeCounter systems, respectively. In this way, we demonstrated the utility of our framework to simulate detector-specific CT images for PCCT systems.",

These studies require realistic, detailed ground-truth models or phantoms of the relevant anatomy or physiology. Anatomical structures within computational phantoms are typically based on medical imaging data; however, for small and intricate structures (e.g. trabecular bone), it is not reasonable to use existing clinical data as the spatial resolution of the scans is insufficient. In this study, we develop a mathematical method to generate arbitrary-resolution bone structures within virtual patient models (XCAT phantoms) to model the appearance of CT-imaged trabecular bone.Approach. Given surface definitions of a bone, an algorithm was implemented to generate stochastic bicontinuous microstructures to form a network to define the trabecular bone structure with geometric and topological properties indicative of the bone. For an example adult male XCAT phantom (50th percentile in height and weight), the method was used to generate the trabecular structure of 46 chest bones. The produced models were validated in comparison with published properties of bones. The utility of the method was demonstrated with pilot CT and photon-counting CT simulations performed using the accurate DukeSim CT simulator on the XCAT phantom containing the detailed bone models.Main results. The method successfully generated the inner trabecular structure for the different bones of the chest, having quantiative measures similar to published values. The pilot simulations showed the ability of photon-counting CT to better resolve the trabecular detail emphasizing the necessity for high-resolution bone models.Significance.As demonstrated, the developed tools have great potential to provide ground truth simulations to access the ability of existing and emerging CT imaging technology to provide quantitative information about bone structures.",

Pollution indexes, including Cd mobility, enrichment factor, geoaccumulation index, contamination index, and availability ratio, were investigated. The structural equation model was also used to evaluate effective parameters on cadmium durability in soil.

The mean values of Cd in different land-use types of rainfed, irrigated, and controlled were 0.15, 0.18, and 0.08 (mg kg-1), respectively. The results indicated that the amount of Cd in both forms (available and total) in ones that received fertilizer, especially P fertilizers, was higher than in the controlled one. Other pollution indexes revealed that the study area had been slightly contaminated due to anthropogenic activities. Lime, clay, lead, and OM were identified as affective parameters on cadmium durability. Finally, the results demonstrated that the mobility rate was high.

In this work, we applied this model to a population of one million CT imaging cases to evaluate the risk stratification with different ages, sexes, and races.\n\nMaterials and Methods. The demographics were informed by literature and census information simulating a clinical liver cancer population. The Total Risk (TR) was calculated as the linear combination of radiation risk and clinical risk. The model included factors for the radiation burden for different age and sex; the prevalence of the disease; the false positive rate; the expected life-expectancy loss for an incorrect diagnosis for different ages, sex, and race; and a typical false positive rate of 5%. It was assumed that each case received an average radiologist interpretative performance of 0.75 AUC for a hypothetical lesion without any changes in radiation dose beyond routine practice. We further, for each patient, simulated 2,000 imaging conditions with CTDIvol varying from 0.1 and 200 mGy with 0.1 mGy increments. Per each CTDIvol value, the anticipated AUC was calculated by applying the established asymptotic relationships between CTDIvol and image quality. The AUC distribution was then used to calculate the theoretical minimum total risk (TRmin) per each patient.\n\nResults. For the routine practice, the median theoretical total risk was estimated to be 0.058 deaths per 100 patients (range: 0.002 – 0.154) comprising of the median radiation risk of 0.009 (range: 0.001 – 0.069), and of the median clinical risk of 0.049 (range: 7.0x10-5 – 0.094). Considering the varying scanner output conditions, the median TRmin was 0.054 deaths per 100 patients for White male patients, 0.054 for Blacks, 0.057 for Hispanics, and 0.065 for Asians. For female patients, the median TRmin values were 0.049, 0.056, 0.054, and 0.061 deaths per 100 patients, respectively.\n\nConclusion. For each demography condition, the clinical risk was found to largely outweigh the radiation risk by at least 500%. Total risk showed different stratifications with patient age and race.\n\nClinical Relevance Statement. To optimize CT conditions for specific patients and/or population, both radiation risk and clinical risks should be all accounted for together with demographic information. We demonstrated a methodology that allows a complete depiction of total risk in CT, considering radiation and clinical risks at comparable units, and patient demographic.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High tube current generates a high flux of x-rays to photon counting detectors (PCDs) that can potentially result in the piling up of pulses formed by concurrent photons, which can cause count loss and energy resolution degradation. PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of clinical photon-counting CT (PCCT) systems in high flux, potentially influenced by pulse pileup effects, in terms of task-generic image quality metrics. METHODS: A clinical phantom was scanned on a commercial PCCT scanner (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens) at 120 kV under fourteen different tube current levels (40-1000 mA) with a rotation time of 0.25 s and a pitch of 1. The dose levels corresponded to CTDIvol (32 cm phantom) of 0.79-19.8 mGy. CT sinograms were reconstructed using QIR-off mode (noniterative reconstruction algorithm), Br44 kernel, and a voxel size of  0.4102 × 0.4102 × 3  mm 3  $0.4102 \\times 0.4102 \\times 3{\\mathrm{\\ mm}}^3$  . imQuest, an open-source MATLAB-based software package was used to calculate noise power spectrum (NPS), task transfer function (TTF), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and CT number according to AAPM Task Group 233 metrology. RESULTS: The 50% cut-off frequency of TTF (f50 ) remained mostly constant across all higher tube currents for all inserts, namely polyethylene, bone, air, and acrylic. Using the lowest two data points (40 and 80 mA), the expected relationship between noise magnitude and tube current was determined to be noise  ∝  $ \\propto \\ $  mA-0.47 . The measured noise magnitude were up to 11.1% higher than the expected value at the highest tube current. The average frequency of NPS (fav ) decreased from 0.32 to 0.29 mm-1 as tube current increased from 40 to 1000 mA. No considerable effects were observed in CT number measurement of any insert; however, CT numbers for air and bone changed almost monotonically as tube current increased. Absolute CNR increased monotonically for all inserts; however, the difference between measured and expected CNRs were approximately -6% to 12% across all tube currents. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing tube currents did not affect the spatial resolution, but slightly affected the CT number and noise measurements of the clinical PCCT system. However, the effects were only considerable at clinically irrelevant tube currents used on a small 20-cm phantom. In general clinical practices, automatic exposure control techniques are used to decrease the variation of flux on the detector, which alleviates the chances of detector saturation due to high count rates. The observed effects could be due to pulse pileup, signal-dependent filtration of the system, or nonlinearities in the reconstruction algorithm. In conclusion, either the deadtime of the detector used in the photon-counting CT system is shorter such that count losses due to pulse pileup are negligible, or pulse pileup has inconsiderable effects on the image quality of clinical photon-counting CT systems in routine clinical practice due to possible corrections applied on the system.",

The assessment of these combined effects has been an open engineering challenge. PURPOSE: In this study, we developed a framework that optimizes imaging parameters for accurate and consistent coronary stenosis quantification in cardiac CTA while accounting for patient-specific variables. METHODS: The framework utilizes a task-specific image quality index, the estimability index (e'), approximated by a surrogate estimability polynomial function (EPF) capable of finding the optimal protocol that (1) maximizes image quality with an upper bound for desired radiation dose or (2) minimizes the dose level with a lower bound of acceptable image quality. The optimization process was formulated with the decision variables being subject to a set of constraints. The methodology was verified using CTA data from a prior clinical trial (prospective multi-center imaging study for evaluation of chest pain) by assessing the concordance of its prediction with the trial results. Further, the framework was used to derive an optimum protocol for each case based on the patient attributes, gauging how much improvement would have been possible if the derived optimized protocol would have been deployed. RESULTS: The framework produced results consistent with imaging physics principles with approximated EPFs of 97% accuracy. The feature importance evaluation demonstrated a close match with earlier studies. The verification study found e' scores closely predicting the cardiologist scores to within 95% in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and predicting potential for either an average of fourfold increase in e' within a targeted dose or a reduction in radiation dose by an average of 57% without reducing the image quality. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol optimization framework provides means to assess and optimize CTA in terms of either image quality or radiation dose objectives with its results predicting prior clinical trial findings.",

In this study, we developed and prospectively tested a clinical graphical  user  interface  (GUI)  tool  which  predicts  enhancement  level  and  suggests  alternative  injection/scanning parameters based on patient attributes (height, weight, sex, age). Methods: This work was based on our retrospectively-validated neural-network prediction model. We built a GUI to combine our model with an optimization algorithm, which suggests alternative injection/scanning parameters for patients with predicted-insufficient enhancement. The system was clinically-deployed and prospectively-tested in 24 patients considering a 110HU+/-10HU target portal-venous HPCE. For each patient, HPCE was calculated as the average HU-value of three ROIs and compared against the target value. Additionally, we compared the outcome with the patient’s previous similarly-protocoled scan to assess improvement and consistency. Results: The system suggested adjustment for 15 patients with median 8.8% and 9.1% reductions to volume and injection rate, respectively. All scan delays were reduced by an average of 42.6%. Comparison with previous scans  shows  increased  consistency  (CV=0.21  v.  0.11,p=0.012)  while  median  enhancement  remained  relatively unchanged  (111.3HU  v.  108.7HU).  The  number  of  under-enhanced  patients  was  halved,  and  all  previously  over-enhanced patients received enhancement reductions. Conclusion: We developed and tested a patient-informed clinical framework which predicts optimal patient’s HPCE; and suggests empiric injection/scanning parameters when predicted enhancement is deemed insufficient. The system improved HPCE consistency and decreased the number of under-enhanced patients as compared to their previous scans. This study demonstrated that the patient-informed clinical framework  can  predict  an  optimal  patient's  HPCE  and  suggest  empiric  injection/scanning  parameters  to  achieve consistent and sufficient HPCE levels.",

                  "abstract": "Purpose \nNoise magnitude is a main CT image quality indicator. In vivo measurements emerged as a patient-specific methodology to assess and qualify CT noise, yet methods to do so vary. Current noise measurement methods in soft tissues and air surrounding the patient use distinct image segmentations, HU thresholds, and region-of-interests, resulting in noise estimation variations. In this study, we compared two noise magnitude calculation methods against the gold standard ensemble noise in two cohorts of virtually-generated patient images across 36 imaging conditions.\nMethods\n1800 image datasets were generated using a virtual trial platform based on anthropomorphic phantoms (XCAT) and a validated, scanner-specific CT simulator (DukeSim). XCAT phantoms were repeatedly imaged 50 times using Chest and Abdominopelvic protocols, three dose levels, and three reconstruction kernels, using both FBP and IR algorithms. Noise magnitudes were calculated in the air surrounding the patient (An) and soft tissues (GNI) by applying HU<-900 and -300<HU<100 thresholds, respectively. Per each imaging condition, An and GNI were compared to the ensemble noise calculated in soft tissue (En) and to the ensemble noise calculated in the liver and in the lungs (On) for abdominopelvic and chest studies, respectively.\nResults\nAcross the three kernels and dose levels, An largely underestimated En and On for both FBP (median differences: -46% and -49%) and IR (median differences: -49% and -51%); whereas the GNI showed closer values to the En and On for FBP (median differences: 4% and 3%) and IR (median differences: -3% and -8%).\nConclusion\nApplying virtual imaging techniques enabled an unbiased comparison of different noise magnitude calculation methods in large and realistic populations simulating clinical conditions. The noise measured in the air surrounding the patient cannot represent noise magnitude in soft tissues. The results affirmed the validation of soft tissue-based noise measurements as a close surrogate to inform protocol design and technology assessment.",

This article reports the outcomes of the first simulation study evaluating the impact of this advantage over energy-integrating CT (ECT) for estimation of morphological radiomics features in lung lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dynamic nutrient-access-based stochastic model was utilized to generate three distinct morphologies for lung lesions. The lesions were inserted into the lung parenchyma of an anthropomorphic phantom (XCAT - 50th percentile BMI) at 50, 70, and 90 mm from isocenter. The phantom was virtually imaged with an imaging simulator (DukeSim) modeling a Si-PCCT and a conventional ECT system using varying imaging conditions (dose, reconstruction kernel, and pixel size). The imaged lesions were segmented using a commercial segmentation tool (AutoContour, Advantage Workstation Server 3.2, GE Healthcare) followed by extraction of morphological radiomics features using an open-source radiomics package (pyradiomics). The estimation errors for both systems were computed as percent differences from corresponding feature values estimated for the ground-truth lesions. RESULTS: Compared to ECT, the mean estimation error was lower for Si-PCCT (independent features: 35.9% vs. 54.0%, all features: 54.5% vs. 68.1%) with statistically significant reductions in errors for 8/14 features. For both systems, the estimation accuracy was minimally affected by dose and distance from the isocenter while reconstruction kernel and pixel size were observed to have a relatively stronger effect. CONCLUSION: For all lesions and imaging conditions considered, Si-PCCT exhibited improved estimation accuracy for morphological radiomics features over a conventional ECT system, demonstrating the potential of this technology for improved quantitative imaging.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: CT scan has notable potential to quantify the severity and progression of emphysema in patients. Such quantification should ideally reflect the true attributes and pathologic conditions of subjects, not scanner parameters. To achieve such an objective, the effects of the scanner conditions need to be understood so the influence can be mitigated. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do CT scan imaging parameters affect the accuracy of emphysema-based quantifications and biomarkers? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty anthropomorphic digital phantoms were developed with diverse anatomic attributes and emphysema abnormalities informed by a real COPD cohort. The phantoms were input to a validated CT scan simulator (DukeSim), modeling a commercial scanner (Siemens Flash). Virtual images were acquired under various clinical conditions of dose levels, tube current modulations (TCM), and reconstruction techniques and kernels. The images were analyzed to evaluate the effects of imaging parameters on the accuracy of density-based quantifications (percent of lung voxels with HU < -950 [LAA-950] and 15th percentile of lung histogram HU [Perc15]) across varied subjects. Paired t tests were performed to explore statistical differences between any two imaging conditions. RESULTS: The most accurate imaging condition corresponded to the highest acquired dose (100 mAs) and iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) with the smooth kernel of I31, where the measurement errors (difference between measurement and ground truth) were 35 ± 3 Hounsfield Units (HU), -4% ± 5%, and 26 ± 10 HU (average ± SD), for the mean lung HU, LAA-950, and Perc15, respectively. Without TCM and at the I31 kernel, increase of dose (20 to 100 mAs) improved the lung mean absolute error (MAE) by 4.2 ± 2.3 HU (average ± SD). TCM did not contribute to a systematic improvement of lung MAE. INTERPRETATION: The results highlight that although CT scan quantification is possible, its reliability is impacted by the choice of imaging parameters. The developed virtual imaging trial platform in this study enables comprehensive evaluation of CT scan methods in reliable quantifications, an effort that cannot be readily made with patient images or simplistic physical phantoms.",

The objective of this paper is to reduce the variability of computed tomography (CT) quantifications for radiomics and biomarkers using physics-based deep neural networks (DNNs). With the proposed framework, it is possible to harmonize the different renditions of a single CT scan (with variations in reconstruction kernel and dose) into an image that is in close agreement with the ground truth. To this end, a generative adversarial network (GAN) model was developed where the generator is informed by the scanner's modulation transfer function (MTF). To train the network, a virtual imaging trial (VIT) platform was used to acquire CT images, from a set of forty computational models (XCAT) serving as the patient model. Phantoms with varying levels of pulmonary disease, such as lung nodules and emphysema, were used. We scanned the patient models with a validated CT simulator (DukeSim) modeling a commercial CT scanner at 20 and 100 mAs dose levels and then reconstructed the images by twelve kernels representing smooth to sharp kernels. An evaluation of the harmonized virtual images was conducted in four different ways: 1) visual quality of the images, 2) bias and variation in density-based biomarkers, 3) bias and variation in morphological-based biomarkers, and 4) Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) and lung histogram. The trained model harmonized the test set images with a structural similarity index of 0.95±0.1, a normalized mean squared error of 10.2±1.5%, and a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 31.8±1.5 dB. Moreover, emphysema-based imaging biomarkers of LAA-950 (-1.5±1.8), Perc15 (13.65±9.3), and Lung mass (0.1±0.3) had more precise quantifications.",

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a new PCCT scanner (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens) in quantifying clinically relevant bone imaging biomarkers for characterization of common bone diseases. We evaluated the ability of PCCT in quantifying microarchitecture in bones compared to conventional energy-integrating CT. The quantifications were done through virtual imaging trials, using a 50 percentile BMI male virtual patient, with a detailed model of trabecular bone with varied bone densities in the lumbar spine. The virtual patient was imaged using a validated CT simulator (DukeSim) at CTDIvol of 20 and 40 mGy for three scan modes: ultra-high-resolution PCCT (UHR-PCCT), high-resolution PCCT (HR-PCCT), and a conventional energy-integrating CT (EICT) (FORCE, Siemens). Further, each scan mode was reconstructed with varying parameters to evaluate their effect on quantification. Bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular volume to total bone volume (BV/TV), and radiomics texture features were calculated in each vertebra. The most accurate BMD measurements relative to the ground truth were UHR-PCCT images (error: 3.3% ± 1.5%), compared to HR-PCCT (error: 5.3% ± 2.0%) and EICT (error: 7.1% ± 2.0%). UHR-PCCT images outperformed EICT and HR-PCCT. In BV/TV quantifications, UHR-PCCT (errors of 29.7% ± 11.8%) outperformed HR-PCCT (error: 80.6% ± 31.4%) and EICT (error: 67.3% ± 64.3). UHR-PCCT and HR-PCCT texture features were sensitive to anatomical changes using the sharpest kernel. Conversely, the texture radiomics showed no clear trend to reflect the progression of the disease in EICT. This study demonstrated the potential utility of PCCT technology in improved performance of bone quantifications leading to more accurate characterization of bone diseases.",

Airway measurements reflect the severity of bronchitis and other airway-related diseases. Airway structures can be objectively evaluated with quantitative computed tomography (CT). The accuracy of such quantifications is limited by the spatial resolution and image noise characteristics of the imaging system and can be potentially improved with the emerging photon-counting CT (PCCT) technology. This study evaluated the quantitative performance of PCCT against energy-integrating CT (EICT) systems for airway measurements, and further identified optimum CT imaging parameters for such quantifications. The study was performed using a novel virtual imaging framework by developing the first library of virtual patients with bronchitis. These virtual patients were developed based on CT images of confirmed COPD patients with varied bronchitis severity. The human models were virtually imaged at 6.3 and 12.6 mGy dose levels using a scanner-specific simulator (DukeSim), synthesizing clinical PCCT and EICT scanners (NAEOTOM Alpha, FLASH, Siemens). The projections were reconstructed with two algorithms and kernels at different matrix sizes and slice thicknesses. The CT images were used to quantify clinically relevant airway measurements (\"Pi10\" and \"WA%\") and compared against their ground truth values. Compared to EICT, PCCT provided more accurate Pi10 and WA% measurements by 63.1% and 68.2%, respectively. For both technologies, sharper kernels and larger matrix sizes led to more reliable bronchitis quantifications. This study highlights the potential advantages of PCCT against EICT in characterizing bronchitis utilizing a virtual imaging platform.",

Limitations in current X-ray technology have nevertheless hindered clinical translation, leaving the potential clinical impact an open question. Here, we explore phase-contrast chest radiography in a realistic in silico framework. Specifically, we use preprocessed virtual patients to generate in silico chest radiographs by Fresnel-diffraction simulations of X-ray wave propagation. Following a reader study conducted with clinical radiologists, we predict that phase-contrast edge enhancement will have a negligible impact on improving solitary pulmonary nodule detection (6 to 20 mm). However, edge enhancement of bronchial walls visualizes small airways (< 2 mm), which are invisible in conventional radiography. Our results show that phase-contrast chest radiography could play a future role in observing small-airway obstruction (e.g., relevant for asthma or early-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which cannot be directly visualized using current clinical methods, thereby motivating the experimental development needed for clinical translation. Finally, we discuss quantitative requirements on distances and X-ray source/detector specifications for clinical implementation of phase-contrast chest radiography.",

Quantitative Computed Tomography (CT) is increasingly used to assess the presence or progression of emphysema. CT quantifications are affected by the acquisition protocols and scanner makes and models. This variability is a major concern for cross-sectional and longitudinal disease characterizations with large-scale, multi-institutional datasets. Therefore, CT images need to be harmonized to reflect the patient condition and not the attributes of the imaging systems. The purpose of this study was to develop a physics-based harmonization framework that transforms CT images to a reference quality index (iso resolution and noise conditions) enabling robust emphysema quantifications across varied CT conditions. The harmonizer was developed using a virtual imaging trial (VIT) platform taking advantage of ground truth knowledge and control over CT parameters in VIT. The developed harmonizer was applied to clinical data from the COPDGene dataset to demonstrate its clinical utility. The established imaging biomarkers of “LAA-950” and “Perc15” were selected for emphysema quantifications. Results demonstrated that the harmonizer improved the quantification performance by reducing the bias in “LAA-950\" from 7.03 (CI: [6.38, 7.68]) to 0.14 (CI: [0.08, 0.20]) after matching for kernel and from 2.48 (CI: [2.21, 2.76]) to −0.34 (CI: [−0.48, −0.20]) after matching for noise settings on the COPDGene dataset.

The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learning-based bone suppression technique for DCR in various projection directions. Twenty breathing XCAT phantoms with lung tumors and a pair of phantoms consisting only of bone structures were generated. The XCAT phantoms were virtually projected from six directions, resulting in 54000 multidirectional chest X-ray images and were used for training a pix2pix model to estimate bone images from original images. Bone suppression (BS) images were created by subtracting the bone images from the original images and then evaluated based on the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and Fréchet Video Distance (FVD). Clinical cases were processed using the trained model as well. Furthermore, lung tumors on the original and BS images were tracked using OpenCV template matching, and the tracking accuracy was compared. The PSNR, SSIM, and FVD were 0.9966, 52.20 and 136.9, respectively. In the visual evaluation, we confirmed the effect of BS without temporal fluctuation of pixel values in both the resulting images of the XCAT phantom and real patients. Furthermore, precise tracking of the targeted tumor was achieved on the resulting BS images even in oblique directions, without any interruption from the rib shadows. These results indicate that our proposed method can effectively reduce bone shadows as well as temporal variations in the effect of bone suppression.",

Instead, virtual imaging trials (VITs) can overcome these hurdles through computer simulations of models of patients and imaging systems. DukeSim is a scanner-specific CT imaging simulator that has previously been validated with simple cylindrical phantoms, but not with anthropomorphic conditions and clinically relevant measurements. PURPOSE: To validate a scanner-specific CT simulator (DukeSim) for the assessment of lung imaging biomarkers under clinically relevant conditions across multiple scanners using an anthropomorphic chest phantom, and to demonstrate the utility of virtual trials by studying the effects or radiation dose and reconstruction kernels on the lung imaging quantifications. METHODS: An anthropomorphic chest phantom with customized tube inserts was imaged with two commercial scanners (Siemens Force and Siemens Flash) at 28 dose and reconstruction conditions. A computational version of the chest phantom was used with a scanner-specific CT simulator (DukeSim) to simulate virtual images corresponding to the settings of the real acquisitions. Lung imaging biomarkers were computed from both real and simulated CT images and quantitatively compared across all imaging conditions. The VIT framework was further utilized to investigate the effects of radiation dose (20-300 mAs) and reconstruction settings (Qr32f, Qr40f, and Qr69f reconstruction kernels using ADMIRE strength 3) on the accuracy of lung imaging biomarkers, compared against the ground-truth values modeled in the computational chest phantom. RESULTS: The simulated CT images matched closely the real images for both scanners and all imaging conditions qualitatively and quantitatively, with the average biomarker percent error of 3.51% (range 0.002%-18.91%). The VIT study showed that sharper reconstruction kernels had lower accuracy with errors in mean lung HU of 84-94 HU, lung volume of 797-3785 cm3 , and lung mass of -800 to 1751 g. Lower tube currents had the lower accuracy with errors in mean lung HU of 6-84 HU, lung volume of 66-3785 cm3 , and lung mass of 170-1751 g. Other imaging biomarkers were consistent under the studied reconstruction settings and tube currents. CONCLUSION: We comprehensively evaluated the realism of DukeSim in an anthropomorphic setup across a diverse range of imaging conditions. This study paves the way toward utilizing VITs more reliably for conducting medical imaging experiments that are not practical using actual patient images.",

METHODS: The study included 1577 Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT scans, with 70-30% training/validation-testing split. A Gaussian function was used to approximate the early arterial, late arterial, and the portal venous phases of the contrast perfusion curve of each patient using their respective bolus tracking and diagnostic scan data. Machine learning models were built to predict the Gaussian parameters of each patient using the patient attributes (weight, height, age, sex, BMI). Pearson's coefficient, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error were used to assess the prediction accuracy. RESULTS: The integration of the pharmacokinetics model with a two-layered neural network achieved the highest prediction accuracy on the test data (R2 = 0.61), significantly exceeding the performance of the pharmacokinetics model alone (R2 = 0.11). Applying the model demonstrated that adjusting the contrast administration directed by the model may reduce clinical enhancement inconsistency by up to 40 %. CONCLUSIONS: A new model using a Gaussian function and supervised machine learning can be used to build liver parenchyma contrast enhancement prediction model. The model can have utility in clinical settings to optimize and improve consistency in contrast-enhanced liver imaging.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Virtual (in silico) imaging trials (VITs), involving computerized phantoms and models of the imaging process, provide a modern alternative to clinical imaging trials. VITs are faster, safer, and enable otherwise-impossible investigations. Current phantoms used in VITs are limited in their ability to model functional behavior such as contrast perfusion which is an important determinant of dose and image quality in CT imaging. In our prior work with the XCAT computational phantoms, we determined and modeled inter-organ (organ to organ) intravenous contrast concentration as a function of time from injection. However, intra-organ concentration, heterogeneous distribution within a given organ, was not pursued. We extend our methods in this work to model intra-organ concentration within the XCAT phantom with a specific focus on the liver. METHODS: Intra-organ contrast perfusion depends on the organ's vessel network. We modeled the intricate vascular structures of the liver, informed by empirical and theoretical observations of anatomy and physiology. The developed vessel generation algorithm modeled a dual-input-single-output vascular network as a series of bifurcating surfaces to optimally deliver flow within the bounding surface of a given XCAT liver. Using this network, contrast perfusion was simulated within voxelized versions of the phantom by using knowledge of the blood velocities in each vascular structure, vessel diameters and length, and the time since the contrast entered the hepatic artery. The utility of the enhanced phantom was demonstrated through a simulation study with the phantom voxelized prior to CT simulation with the relevant liver vasculature prepared to represent blood and iodinated contrast media. The spatial extent of the blood-contrast mixture was compared to clinical data. RESULTS: The vascular structures of the liver were generated with size and orientation which resulted in minimal energy expenditure required to maintain blood flow. Intravenous contrast was simulated as having known concentration and known total volume in the liver as calibrated from time-concentration curves. Measurements of simulated CT ROIs were found to agree with clinically observed values of early arterial phase contrast enhancement of the parenchyma (  ∼ 5 $ \\sim 5$  HU). Similarly, early enhancement in the hepatic artery was found to agree with average clinical enhancement  ( 180 $(180$  HU). CONCLUSIONS: The computational methods presented here furthered the development of the XCAT phantoms allowing for multi-timepoint contrast perfusion simulations, enabling more anthropomorphic virtual clinical trials intended for optimization of current clinical imaging technologies and applications.",

This study aims to ascertain if applying bias corrections can improve the classification performance of the radiomics features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 144 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patient CT images was used to calculate radiomics features for use in predictive models of patient pathological stage. Simulation models of the tumors, matched to patient lesion qualities of size, contrast, and degree of spiculation, were used to both create and assess protocol-specific correction factors. The usefulness of correction was first assessed by applying the corrections to simulated lesion phantoms with known properties using a corrected paired Student's t-test. The sensitivity of radiomics features to correction factors was assessed by applying a library of possible theoretical correction factors to the uncorrected radiomics from the patient data. The data were then used to assess the effect of the correction on prediction performance (AUC) from a logistic regression radiomics model across the patient cases. RESULTS: The correction factors were shown to reduce the bias of radiomics features, caused by protocols, provided that the correction factors were derived from lesion models with similar properties. The sensitivity of the radiomics features to changes due to protocol effects was on average 89% among all features. The corrections applied to patient data resulted in a small increase of 0.0074 in AUC that was not statistically significant (p=0.60). CONCLUSION: Protocol-specific correction factors can be applied to radiomics studies to control for biases introduced by different imaging protocols. The correction factors should ideally be lesion-specific, derived using lesion models that echo patient lesion characteristics in terms of size, contrast, and degree of spiculation. Small corrections in the 10% range offers only a small improvement in the predictability of radiomics.",

Quantitative analysis correlated with CT values is beneficial for a better understanding of Δpixel values in DCR-based assessment of pulmonary function. The present study aimed to correlate Δpixel values from DCR with changes in CT values during respiration (ΔCT values) through a computer-based phantom study. A total of 20 four-dimensional computational phantoms during forced breathing were created to simulate both CT and projection images of the same virtual patients. The Δpixel and ΔCT values of the lung fields were correlated on a regression line, and the inclination was statistically evaluated to determine whether there were significant differences among physical types, sex, and breathing methods. The resulting conversion expression was also assessed in the DCR images of 37 patients. The resulting Δpixel values for 30/37 (81%) real patients, 6/7 (86%) normal controls, and 24/30 (80%) chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder patients were within the range of ΔCT values ± standard deviation (SD) reported in a previous study. In addition, no significant differences were detected for each condition of thoracic breathing, suggesting that the same regression line inclination values measured across the entire lung can be used for the conversion of Δpixel values, providing a quantitative analysis that can be correlated with ΔCT values. The developed conversion expression may be helpful for improving the understanding of respiratory changes using radiographic lung densities from DCR-based assessments of pulmonary function.",

Variability across images from the same scanner and from different scanners was analyzed by computing coefficients of variation (CV) and standard deviations of HU values. LAA -950 and LAA -856 biomarkers had the highest levels of variability, while the majority of other biomarkers had variability less than 10 HU or 10% CV in both inter and intra-scan measurements.

The PCCT simulator was built upon the DukeSim platform, which generates projection images of computational phantoms given the geometry and physics of the scanner and imaging parameters. DukeSim was adapted to account for the geometry of the PCCT prototype. To model the photon-counting detection process, we utilized a Monte Carlo-based detector model with the known properties of the detectors. We validated the simulation platform against experimental measurements. The images were acquired at four dose levels (CTDIvol of 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, and 12.0 mGy) and reconstructed with three kernels (Br36, Br40, Br48). The experimental acquisitions were replicated using our developed simulation platform. The real and simulated images were quantitatively compared in terms of image quality metrics (HU values, noise magnitude, noise power spectrum, and modulation transfer function). The clinical utility of our framework was demonstrated by conducting two clinical applications (COPD quantifications and lung nodule radiomics). The phantoms with relevant pathologies were imaged with DukeSim modeling the PCCT systems. Different imaging parameters (e.g., dose, reconstruction techniques, pixel size, and slice thickness) were altered to investigate their effects on task-based quantifications. We successfully implemented the acquisition and physics attributes of the PCCT prototype into the DukeSim platform. The discrepancy between the real and simulated data was on average about 2 HU in terms of noise magnitude, 0.002 mm-1 in terms of noise power spectrum peak frequency and 0.005 mm-1 in terms of the frequency at 50% MTF. Analysis suggested that lung lesion radiomics to be more accurate with reduced pixel size and slice thickness. For COPD quantifications, higher doses, thinner slices, and softer kernels yielded more accurate quantification of density-based biomarkers. Our developed virtual imaging platform enables systematic comparison of new PCCT technologies as well as optimization of the imaging parameters for specific clinical tasks.",

Quantitative CT is a powerful tool to better understand the heterogeneity and severity of this disease. Quantitative CT is being increasingly used in COPD research, and the recent advancements in CT technology have made it even more encouraging. One recent advancement has been the development of photon-counting detectors, offering higher spatial resolution, higher image contrast, and lower noise levels in the images. However, the quantification performance of this new technology compared to conventional scanners remains unknown. Additionally, different protocol settings (e.g., different dose levels, slice thicknesses, reconstruction kernels and algorithms) affect quantifications in an unsimilar fashion. This study investigates the potential advantages of photon-counting CT (PCCT) against conventional energy-integrating detector (EID) CT and explores the effects of protocol settings on lung density quantifications in COPD patients. This study was made possible using a virtual imaging platform, taking advantage of anthropomorphic phantoms with COPD (COPD-XCAT) and a scanner-specific CT simulator (DukeSim). Having the physical and geometrical properties of three Siemens commercial scanners (Flash, Force for EID and NAEOTOM Alpha for PCCT) modeled, we simulated CT images of ten COPD-XCAT phantoms at 0.63 and 3.17 mGy dose levels and reconstructed at three levels of kernel sharpness. The simulated CT images were quantified in terms of \"Lung mean absolute error (MAE),\" \"LAA -950,\" \"Perc 15,\" \"Lung mass\" imaging biomarkers and compared against the ground truth values of the phantoms. The intra-scanner assessment demonstrated the superior qualitative and quantitative performance of the PCCT scanner over the conventional scanners (21.01% and 22.74% mean lung MAE improvement, and 53.97% and 68.13% mean LAA -950 error improvement compared to Flash and Force). The results also showed that higher mAs, thinner slices, smoother kernels, and iterative reconstruction could lead to more accurate and precise quantification scores. This study underscored the qualitative and quantitative benefits of PCCT against conventional EID scanners as well as the importance of optimal protocol choice within scanners for more accurate quantifications.",

Modeling this inverse operation is not straightforward. Given the ill-posed nature of inverse problem in CT reconstruction, data-driven methods need regularization to enhance the accuracy of the reconstructed images. Besides, generalization of the results hinges upon the availability of large training datasets with access to ground truth. This paper offers a new strategy to reconstruct CT images with the advantage of ground truth accessible through a virtual imaging trial (VIT) platform. A learned primal-dual deep neural network (LPD-DNN) employed the forward model and its adjoint as a surrogate of the imaging's geometry and physics. VIT offered simulated CT projections paired with ground truth labels from anthropomorphic human models without image noise and resolution degradation. The models included a library of anthropomorphic, computational patient models (XCAT). The DukeSim simulator was utilized to form realistic projection data emulating the impact of the physics and geometry of a commercial-equivalent CT scanner. The resultant noisy sinogram data associated with each slice was thus generated for training. Corresponding linear attenuation coefficients of phantoms' materials at the effective energy of the x-ray spectrum were used as the ground truth labels. The LPD-DNN was deployed to learn the complex operators and hyper-parameters in the proximal primal-dual optimization. The obtained validation results showed a 12% normalized root mean square error with respect to the ground truth labels, a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32 dB, a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, and a structural similarity index of 96%.

Second, we trained 3D-UNet after including the CT-ORG dataset into the training set to have more quantity. Performance improved for segmentation in the organs where we have true labels in both datasets and degraded when relying on pseudo-labels.

To facilitate advancements in research and clinical practice, we developed a vendor-neutral pipeline for virtual imaging trials involving cardiac CT simulation and reconstruction. Specifically, we developed a reconstruction method to be combined with dynamic virtual patients (XCAT) and a CT simulator (DukeSim) to generate realistic, retrospectively gated, helical cardiac CT projection data sets. Reconstruction was performed using a multi-channel GPU-based reconstruction toolkit. In this study, CT simulation experiments were performed using a standard adult male XCAT phantom (50th percentile in height and weight) with heart rates of 60, 90, and 120 bpm. The simulated acquisitions were done with a tube voltage of 120 kV, a pitch of 0.14, and a rotation time of 280 msec. Reconstruction was performed analytically, with rebinning and weighted filtered backprojection, and iteratively, with the split Bregman optimization method and low rank and gradient sparsity regularizers. Image quality (SSIM, RMSE) and temporal resolution were evaluated and compared with the ground truth phantoms. Iterative reconstruction was shown to reduce noise power by one order of magnitude without significantly impacting image resolution (NPS, MTF). Analytical reconstructions lead to less than 8% error in the measurement of standard cardiac functional metrics relative to ground truth values.",

An XCAT phantom of a one-year-old infant with normal breathing and heart rate was generated. An air sphere was inserted into the lung to simulate a locally collapsed lung. The XCAT phantom was imaged at various combinations of imaging rate (6 or 15 frames/sec), tube voltage (50-100 kV), and mAs (0.08, 0.11, 0.16, 0.20 mAs/frame) using an X-ray simulator. The maximum changes in pixel value (Δpixel values) during respiration were measured on the projected air sphere and its surrounding normal regions to calculate the reduction rate of Ǐ\"pixel values (Δpixel values%). On the requirements that the total entrance surface dose (ESD) is less than twice as that in conventional pediatric chest radiography, and that at least 4 sec imaging period is required to include 2 to 3 respiratory cycles for the assessment of pulmonary function, optimum imaging conditions were identified as those yielding a higher Δpixel values%. In the results, Ǐ\"pixel values and Ǐ\"pixel values% were found to increase with the increase in tube voltage and mAs/frame, indicating higher tube voltage and mAs are more advantageous for the detection of ventilatory impairments. On the other hand, the ESD metrics also indicated several conditions satisfying the requirements. We confirmed that the use in combination of Ǐ\"pixel values% and ESD metrics allowed to reach recommended ones (e.g., 60 kV, 0.16 mAs/frame) for the evaluation of pulmonary function in pediatric DCR. The VIT was useful to identify optimum imaging conditions and image quality in pediatric DCR.",

This problem has been especially concerning over the last year with numerous applications of deep learning for COVID-19 diagnosis. Virtual imaging trials (VITs) could provide a solution for objective evaluation of these models. In this work utilizing the VITs, we created the CVIT-COVID dataset including 180 virtually imaged computed tomography (CT) images from simulated COVID-19 and normal phantom models under different COVID-19 morphology and imaging properties. We evaluated the performance of an open-source, deep-learning model from the University of Waterloo trained with multi-institutional data and an in-house model trained with the open clinical dataset called MosMed. We further validated the model's performance against open clinical data of 305 CT images to understand virtual vs. real clinical data performance. The open-source model was published with nearly perfect performance on the original Waterloo dataset but showed a consistent performance drop in external testing on another clinical dataset (AUC=0.77) and our simulated CVIT-COVID dataset (AUC=0.55). The in-house model achieved an AUC of 0.87 while testing on the internal test set (MosMed test set). However, performance dropped to an AUC of 0.65 and 0.69 when evaluated on clinical and our simulated CVIT-COVID dataset. The VIT framework offered control over imaging conditions, allowing us to show there was no change in performance as CT exposure was changed from 28.5 to 57 mAs. The VIT framework also provided voxel-level ground truth, revealing that performance of in-house model was much higher at AUC=0.87 for diffuse COVID-19 infection size <2.65% lung volume versus AUC=0.52 for focal disease with <2.65% volume. The virtual imaging framework enabled these uniquely rigorous analyses of model performance, which would be impracticable with real patients.",

Virtual patients (XCAT phantoms) were modeled at three BMIs (22%, 52%, and 88%), with three lesions in each phantom. The lesions were modeled with varying spiculation levels (low, medium, high). A scanner-specific CT simulator (DukeSim), setup to model the NAEOTOM Alpha scanner, was used to simulate imaging of the virtual patients under varying radiation dose (5.7 to 17.1 mGy) and reconstruction parameters (matrix size of 512x512 and 1024x1024, kernels of Bl56, Br56, and Qr56, and slice thicknesses of 0.4 to 3.0 mm). A morphological snakes segmentation method was used to segment the lesions in the reconstructed images. The segmented masks were used to calculate morphological radiomic features across all acquired images. The original phantoms were also run through the same radiomics software to serve as ground truth measurements. The radiomics features were found to be most dependent on slice thickness and least dependent on dose level. By increasing the dose from 5.7 mGy to 17.1 mGy the accuracy in the radiomics measurements increased at most by 2.0%. The Qr56 kernel, 0.34 mm in-plane pixel size and 0.4 mm slice thickness had the more accurate measurements of morphological features (e.g., error of 6.7 ± 5.6 % vs. 11.8 ± 9.6% for mesh volume).",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The current state-of-the-art calculation of detectability index (d') is largely phantom-based, with the latest being based on a hybrid phantom noise power spectrum (NPS) combined with patient-specific noise magnitude and high-contrast air-skin interface. The purpose of this study was to develop and assess the use of fully patient-specific measurements of noise and low-contrast resolution, derived entirely from patient images on d'. METHODS: This study developed a d' calculation that is patient- and task-specific, employing newly developed algorithms for estimating patient-specific NPS and low-contrast task transfer function (TTF). The TTF estimation methodology used a trained regression support vector machine (SVM) to estimate a fitted form of the TTF given a variance-normalized estimate of the NPS (referred to as the TTFNPS ). The regression SVM was trained and tested using five-fold cross-validation on 192 scans (4 dose levels x 6 reconstruction kernels x 4 repeats) of a phantom with low-contrast polyethylene insert and reconstructed with filtered backprojection and iterative reconstructions across 12 clinically relevant kernels (FBP: B20f, B31f, B45f; SAFIRE: I26f, I31f, J45f with strengths: 2, 3, 5). To test the low-contrast TTF estimation method, the estimated TTFNPS measurements were compared to (1) TTF measurements from the air-phantom interface (referred to as the TTFair , representing the most patient-specific clinical alternative) and (2) TTF measurements from the edge of the low-contrast polyethylene insert (referred to as the TTFpoly ), which represented the gold standard of low-contrast TTF measurement. Patient-specific NPS, patient-specific noise magnitude, and patient-specific low-contrast TTF were further combined with a reference task function to calculate a d' (according to a non-prewhitening matched filter model) across 1120 lesions previously evaluated in 2AFC human observer detection of liver lesions. The resulting values were compared to the observer results using a generalized linear mixed-effects statistical model. The correlations between the model and observer results were also compared with previously reported values (using a hybrid method with phantom-derived NPS and TTFair ). RESULTS: The TTFNPS more accurately represented resolution across the considered reconstruction settings, compared with the TTFair . The out-of-fold predictions of the TTFNPS had statistically better root-mean-square error concordance (p < 0.05, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test) to gold standard than the TTFair (the alternative, measured from the air-phantom interface). Detectability indices informed by purely patient-specific NPS and TTF were strongly correlated with 2AFC outcomes (p < 0.05). R2 between human detection accuracy and model-predicted detection accuracy were shown to be greater for those measured with patient-specific d' than for the hybrid d' but failed to rise to the level of statistical significance (p ≥ 0.05, bootstrap resampled corrected paired Student's t-test). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that fully patient-specific characterization of image quality based on in vivo NPS and low-contrast TTF offer advantages over hybrid methods. The results in terms of d' favorably relate to observer detection of liver lesions. The method can potentially be integrated into an automated image quality tracking system to assess image quality across a computed tomography clinical operation without needing phantom scans.",

Transfer learning techniques for images using well-known convolutional neural networks show promise in addressing this problem. These methods can significantly benefit from supplemental training on similar conditions, considering that there currently exists no widely available chest x-ray dataset on COVID-19. We evaluate whether targeted pretraining for similar tasks in radiography labeling improves classification performance in a sample radiograph dataset containing COVID-19 cases. Approach: We train a DenseNet121 to classify chest radiographs through six training schemes. Each training scheme is designed to incorporate cases from established datasets for general findings in chest radiography (CXR) and pneumonia, with a control scheme with no pretraining. The resulting six permutations are then trained and evaluated on a dataset of 1060 radiographs collected from 475 patients after March 2020, containing 801 images of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Results: Sequential training phases yielded substantial improvement in classification accuracy compared to a baseline of standard transfer learning with ImageNet parameters. The test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for COVID-19 classification improved from 0.757 in the control to 0.857 for the optimal training scheme in the available images. Conclusions: We achieve COVID-19 classification accuracies comparable to previous benchmarks of pneumonia classification. Deliberate sequential training, rather than pooling datasets, is critical in training effective COVID-19 classifiers within the limitations of early datasets. These findings bring clinical-grade classification through CXR within reach for more regions impacted by COVID-19.",

The goal of this study was to develop such a framework to (1) facilitate patient-specific optimization of TCM parameters and (2) enable future virtual imaging trials (VITs) with more clinically realistic image quality and x-ray flux distributions. The framework was created by developing a TCM module and integrating it with an existing CT simulator (DukeSim). The developed module utilizes scanner-calibrated TCM parameters and two localizer radiographs to compute the mAs for each simulated CT projection. This simulation pipeline was validated in two parts. First, DukeSim was validated in the context of a commercial scanner with TCM (SOMATOM Force, Siemens Healthineers) by imaging a physical CT phantom (Mercury, Sun Nuclear) and its computational analogue. Second, the TCM module was validated by imaging a computational anthropomorphic phantom (ATOM, CIRS) using DukeSim with real and module-generated TCM profiles. The validation demonstrated DukeSim's realism in terms of noise magnitude, noise texture, spatial resolution, and image contrast (with average differences of 0.38%, 6.31%, 0.43%, and -9 HU, respectively). It also demonstrated the TCM module's realism in terms of projection-level mAs and resulting noise magnitude (2.86% and -2.60%, respectively). Finally, the framework was applied to a pilot VIT simulating images of three computational anthropomorphic phantoms (XCAT, with body mass indices (BMIs) of 24.3, 28.2, and 33.0) under five different TCM settings. The optimal TCM for each phantom was characterized based on various criteria, such as minimizing mAs or maximizing image quality. 'Very Weak' TCM minimized noise for the 24.3 BMI phantom, while 'Very Strong' TCM minimized noise for the 33.0 BMI phantom. This illustrates the utility of the developed framework for future optimization studies of TCM parameters and, more broadly, large-scale VITs with scanner-specific TCM.",

Approach: The method identifies target regions within patient scans that are least likely to have major contribution of patient anatomy, detrends them locally, and measures noise power spectrum (NPS) there using a previously phantom-validated technique targeting perceptual noise-non-anatomical fluctuations in the image that may interfere with the detection of focal lesions. Method development and validation used scanner-specific CT simulations of computational, anthropomorphic phantom (XCAT phantom, three phases of contrast-enhancement) with known ground truth of the NPS. Simulations were based on a clinical scanner (Definition Flash, Siemens) and clinically relevant settings (tube voltage of 120 kV at three dose levels). Images were reconstructed with filtered backprojection (kernel: B31, B41, and B50) and Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction (kernel: I31, I41, and I50) using a manufacturer-specific reconstruction software (ReconCT, Siemens). All NPS measurements were made in the liver. Ground-truth NPS were taken as the sum of (1) a measurement in parenchymal regions of anatomy-subtracted (i.e., noise only) scans, and (2) a measurement in the same region of noise-free (pre-noise-insertion) images. To assess in vivo NPS performance, correlation of NPS average frequency (   f avg    ), was reported. Sensitivity of accuracy [root-mean-square-error (RMSE)] to number of pixels included in measurement was conducted via bootstrapped pixel-dropout. Sensitivity of NPS to dose and reconstruction kernel was assessed to confirm that ground truth NPS similarities were maintained in patient-specific measurements. Results: Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients 0.97 and 0.96 for   f avg    indicated good correlation. Results suggested accurate NPS measurements (within 5% total RMSE) could be acquired with ∼ 10 6     pixels  . Conclusions: Relationships of similar NPS due to reconstruction kernel and dose were preserved between gold standard and observed in vivo estimations. The NPS estimation method was further deployed on clinical cases to demonstrate the feasibility of clinical analysis.",

The framework is applied to assess radiation dose to radiosensitive organs in CT imaging of individual patients. METHOD: Given a volume of patient CT images, iPhantom segments selected anchor organs and structures (e.g., liver, bones, pancreas) using a learning-based model developed for multi-organ CT segmentation. Organs which are challenging to segment (e.g., intestines) are incorporated from a matched phantom template, using a diffeomorphic registration model developed for multi-organ phantom-voxels. The resulting digital-twin phantoms are used to assess organ doses during routine CT exams. RESULT: iPhantom was validated on both with a set of XCAT digital phantoms (n = 50) and an independent clinical dataset (n = 10) with similar accuracy. iPhantom precisely predicted all organ locations yielding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) 0.6 - 1 for anchor organs and DSC of 0.3-0.9 for all other organs. iPhantom showed <10% errors in estimated radiation dose for the majority of organs, which was notably superior to the state-of-the-art baseline method (20-35% dose errors). CONCLUSION: iPhantom enables automated and accurate creation of patient-specific phantoms and, for the first time, provides sufficient and automated patient-specific dose estimates for CT dosimetry. SIGNIFICANCE: The new framework brings the creation and application of CHPs (computational human phantoms) to the level of individual CHPs through automation, achieving wide and precise organ localization, paving the way for clinical monitoring, personalized optimization, and large-scale research.",

Recent advances in digital radiography allow a motion analysis of lung tumors with dynamic chest radiography (DCR) with total exposure dose comparable to that of conventional chest radiography. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of preoperative evaluation of pleural invasion/adhesion of lung tumors with DCR through a virtual clinical imaging study, using a four-dimensional (4D) extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) computational phantom. METHODS: An XCAT phantom of an adult man (50th percentile in height and weight) with simulated respiratory and cardiac motions was generated to use as a virtual patient. To simulate lung tumors with and without pleural invasion, a 30-mm diameter tumor sphere was inserted into each lobe of the phantom. The virtual patient during respiration was virtually projected using an x-ray simulator in posteroanterior (PA) and oblique directions, and sequential bone suppression (BS) images were created. The measurement points (tumor, rib, and diaphragm) were automatically tracked on simulated images by a template matching technique. We calculated five quantitative metrics related to the movement distance and directions of the targeted tumor and evaluated whether DCR could distinguish between tumors with and without pleural invasion/adhesion. RESULTS: Precise tracking of the targeted tumor was achieved on the simulated BS images without undue influence of rib shadows. There was a significant difference in all five quantitative metrics between the lung tumors with and without pleural invasion both on the oblique and PA projection views (P < 0.05). Quantitative metrics related to the movement distance were effective for tumors in the middle and lower lobes, while, those related to the movement directions were effective for tumors close to the frontal chest wall on the oblique projection view. The oblique views were useful for the evaluation of the space between the chest wall and a moving tumor. CONCLUSION: DCR could help distinguish between tumors with and without pleural invasion/adhesion based on the two-dimensional movement distance and direction using oblique and PA projection views. With anticipated improved image: processing to evaluate the respiratory displacement of lung tumors in the upper lobe or behind the heart, DCR holds promise for clinical assessment of tumor invasion/adhesion in the parietal pleura.",

The clinical potential of VITs hinges on the realism of simulations modeling the image acquisition process, where the accurate scanner-specific simulation of scatter in a time-feasible manner poses a particular challenge. To meet this need, this study proposes, develops, and validates a rapid scatter estimation framework, based on GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and denoising methods, for estimating scatter in single source, dual-source, and photon-counting CT. A CT simulator was developed to incorporate parametric models for an anti-scatter grid and a curved energy integrating detector with an energy-dependent response. The scatter estimates from the simulator were validated using physical measurements acquired on a clinical CT system using the standard single-blocker method. The MC simulator was further extended to incorporate a pre-validated model for a PCD and an additional source-detector pair to model cross scatter in dual-source configurations. To estimate scatter with desirable levels of statistical noise using a manageable computational load, two denoising methods using a (1) convolutional neural network and an (2) optimized Gaussian filter were further deployed. The viability of this framework for clinical VITs was assessed by integrating it with a scanner-specific ray-tracer program to simulate images for an image quality (Mercury) and an anthropomorphic phantom (XCAT). The simulated scatter-to-primary ratios agreed with physical measurements within 4.4% ± 10.8% across all projection angles and kVs. The differences of ∼121 HU between images with and without scatter, signifying the importance of scatter for simulating clinical images. The denoising methods preserved the magnitudes and trends observed in the reference scatter distributions, with an averaged rRMSE value of 0.91 and 0.97 for the two methods, respectively. The execution time of ∼30 s for simulating scatter in a single projection with a desirable level of statistical noise indicates a major improvement in performance, making our tool an eligible candidate for conducting extensive VITs spanning multiple patients and scan protocols.",

The virtual imaging trial is a unique framework that can greatly facilitate the assessment and optimization of imaging methods by emulating the imaging experiment using representative computational models of patients and validated imaging simulators. The purpose of this study was to show how virtual imaging trials can be adapted for imaging studies of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), enabling effective assessment and optimization of CT and radiography acquisitions and analysis tools for reliable imaging and management of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We developed the first computational models of patients with COVID-19 and as a proof of principle showed how they can be combined with imaging simulators for COVID-19 imaging studies. For the body habitus of the models, we used the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) model that was developed at Duke University. The morphologic features of COVID-19 abnormalities were segmented from 20 CT images of patients who had been confirmed to have COVID-19 and incorporated into XCAT models. Within a given disease area, the texture and material of the lung parenchyma in the XCAT were modified to match the properties observed in the clinical images. To show the utility, three developed COVID-19 computational phantoms were virtually imaged using a scanner-specific CT and radiography simulator. RESULTS. Subjectively, the simulated abnormalities were realistic in terms of shape and texture. Results showed that the contrast-to-noise ratios in the abnormal regions were 1.6, 3.0, and 3.6 for 5-, 25-, and 50-mAs images, respectively. CONCLUSION. The developed toolsets in this study provide the foundation for use of virtual imaging trials in effective assessment and optimization of CT and radiography acquisitions and analysis tools to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Custom 3D-printed total talus replacement (TTR) and combined total ankle total talus replacement (TATTR) have emerged as treatment options for these pathologies. However, the safety and efficacy of these implants is unknown due to the limited number of cases and short follow-up durations. METHODS: This was a retrospective study to assess surgical outcomes of patients who underwent a TTR and TATTR with or without subtalar fusion. Patient demographics, intraoperative parameters, device related surgical and non-surgical events, imaging and clinical evaluations, and patient reported outcome (PRO) measures were compiled. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients received a custom 3D-printed implant with mean follow-up time of 22.1 (range: 12-45) months. In this cohort, 7 (18.4 %) required secondary surgery and 3 (7.9 %) required implant removal. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that patient diagnosis of depression was a significant predictor of secondary surgery with an OR 17.50 (p = 0.037). Significant postoperative improvements were observed in the talocalcaneal height (p = 0.005) and talar declination angle (p = 0.013) for the TATTR group. VAS and PROMIS pain interference (PI) scores demonstrated an initial significant improvement in pain, but this improvement did not maintain significance at most recent follow-up. However, there was a significant increase in the PROMIS physical function (PF) scores (p = 0.037) at most recent follow-up. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that TTR and TATTR provide significant improvement in post-operative radiographic foot and ankle alignment and physical function at the two-year timepoint. PRO findings suggest that patients are more active after surgery. Surgeons considering proceeding with either of these procedures should counsel patients about pain and functional outcomes as well as realistic expectations in patients with depression.

Until recently, HAI was only performed at a limited number of centers. We previously reported early outcomes suggesting that implementation of a new HAI program is safe and feasible. Here, we report perioperative and oncologic outcomes from an expanded series of patients with uCRLM treated with HAI. METHODS: We analyzed outcomes from consecutive patients with uCRLM who underwent HAI pump (HAIP) placement at Duke University Hospital from 2018 to 2023. Demographics, prior treatment, and perioperative and oncologic outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 102 patients underwent HAIP placement for uCRLM; 62% were male and median age was 51 years. Most patients (97%) received a median of 12 (range 0-66) prior chemotherapy cycles. Postoperative HAI-specific complications occurred in 23% of patients, including biliary sclerosis in 6%, and the 90-day mortality rate was 3%. 20% converted to resection, 4% underwent transplant, and 2% achieved complete response at 6 months after floxuridine initiation. Median hepatic and extrahepatic progression-free survival (PFS) was 15.7 months and 11.6 months, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 38 months from the time of pump implantation (median follow-up time: 30 months). CONCLUSIONS: HAI for uCRLM is safe, feasible, and effective at a new center, with outcomes that recapitulate those previously reported by established centers. Future analysis of our institutional data, which includes mutation status, primary tumor sidedness, and extent of prior therapy could inform selection and treatment strategies for new HAI programs.",

Despite the intense efforts to identify and characterize biomarkers in patients with cancer, little is known regarding the natural variation of biomarkers in healthy populations. Here we conducted a clinical study to evaluate the natural variability of biomarkers over time in healthy participants. METHODS: The angiome multiplex array, a panel of 25 circulating protein biomarkers, was assessed in 28 healthy participants across eight timepoints over the span of 60 days. We utilized the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to quantify the reliability of the biomarkers. Adjusted ICC values were calculated under the framework of a linear mixed-effects model, taking into consideration age, sex, body mass index, fasting status, and sampling factors. RESULTS: ICC was calculated to determine the reliability of each biomarker. Hepatocyte growth factor was the most stable marker (ICC = 0.973), while platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB was the most variable marker (ICC = 0.167). In total, ICC analyses revealed that 22 out of 25 measured biomarkers display good (≥0.4) to excellent (>0.75) ICC values. Three markers (PDGF-BB, TGFβ1, PDGF-AA) had ICC values <0.4. Greater age was associated with higher IL6 (P = 0.0114). Higher body mass index was associated with higher levels of IL6 (P = 0.0003) and VEGF-R3 (P = 0.0045). CONCLUSIONS: Of the 25 protein biomarkers measured over this short time period, 22 markers were found to have good or excellent ICC values, providing additional validation for this biomarker assay. IMPACT: These data further support the validation of the angiome biomarker assay and its application as an integrated biomarker in clinical trial testing.",

This phase 2 trial investigated the activity of cediranib/olaparib in relapsed ovarian cancer and its association with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). METHODS: Seventy patients were enrolled to cohorts of either platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and received olaparib tablets 200 mg twice daily and cediranib tablets 30 mg once daily under a continuous dosing schedule. HRD testing was performed on pre-treatment, on-treatment and archival biopsies by sequencing key homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes and by genomic LOH analysis. The primary objective for the platinum-sensitive cohort was the association of HRD, defined as presence of HRR gene mutation, with progression-free survival (PFS). The primary objective for the platinum-resistant cohort was objective response rate (ORR), with a key secondary endpoint evaluating the association of HRD status with activity. RESULTS: In platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (N = 35), ORR was 77.1% (95% CI 59.9-89.6%) and median PFS was 16.4 months (95% CI 13.2-18.6). Median PFS in platinum-sensitive HRR-HRD cancers (N = 22) was 16.8 months (95% CI 11.3-18.6), and 16.4 months (95% CI 9.4-NA) in HRR-HR proficient cancers (N = 13; p = 0.57).

Eligible patients with locally advanced cervical, endometrial or vaginal tumors were treated with a 5-week course of pelvic external beam radiation 45-50 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy daily fractions plus concurrent weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 and adavosertib 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 3 and 5 of each week during chemoradiation. The primary endpoint was to determine the recommended phase II dose of adavosertib. Secondary endpoints included toxicity profile and preliminary efficacy. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled (nine locally advanced cervical and one endometrial cancer). Two patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity at dose level 1 (adavosertib 100 mg by mouth daily on days 1, 3 and 5), including one patient with grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and one with treatment hold >1 week due to grade 1 creatinine elevation and grade 1 thrombocytopenia. At dose level -1 (adavosertib 100 mg by mouth daily on days 3 and 5), one out of five patients enrolled had a dose-limiting toxicity in the form of persistent grade 3 diarrhea. The overall response rate at 4 months was 71.4%, including four complete responses. At 2 years follow-up, 86% of patients were alive and progression-free. CONCLUSION: The recommended phase II dose could not be determined due to clinical toxicity and early trial closure. Preliminary efficacy appears promising, yet selecting the adequate dose/schedule in combination chemoradiation warrants further investigation to limit overlapping toxicities.",

                  "abstract": "KRAS mutations are prevalent in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and are critical to fostering tumor growth in part by aberrantly rewiring glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Corroborating this epidemiological observation, mice harboring mutant KRAS are highly vulnerable to obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) challenges leading to the development of PDAC with high penetrance. However, the contributions of other macronutrient diets, such as diets rich in carbohydrates that are regarded as a more direct source to fuel glycolysis for cancer cell survival and proliferation than HFD, to pancreatic tumorigenesis remain unclear. In this study, we compared the differential effects of a high-carbohydrate diet (HCD), an HFD, and a high-protein diet (HPD) in PDAC development using a mouse model expressing an endogenous level of mutant KRASG12D specifically in pancreatic acinar cells. Our study showed that although with a lower tumorigenic capacity than chronic HFD, chronic HCD promoted acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions with increased inflammation, fibrosis, and cell proliferation compared to the normal diet (ND) in KrasG12D/+ mice. By contrast, chronic HPD showed no significant adverse effects compared to the ND. Furthermore, ablation of pancreatic acinar cell cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) in KrasG12D/+ mice abrogated the adverse effects induced by HCD, suggesting that diet-induced pancreatic inflammation is critical for promoting oncogenic KRAS-mediated neoplasia. These results indicate that diets rich in different macronutrients have differential effects on pancreatic tumorigenesis in which the ensuing inflammation exacerbates the process. Management of macronutrient intake aimed at thwarting inflammation is thus an important preventive strategy for patients harboring oncogenic KRAS.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is resistant to PD-1 and PD-L1 (PD[L]-1)-targeted therapy have poor outcomes. Studies suggest that radiotherapy could enhance antitumour immunity. Therefore, we investigated the potential benefit of PD-L1 (durvalumab) and CTLA-4 (tremelimumab) inhibition alone or combined with radiotherapy. METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 2 trial was done by the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network at 18 US sites. Patients aged 18 years or older with metastatic NSCLC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and progression during previous PD(L)-1 therapy were eligible. They were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in a web-based system by the study statistician using a permuted block scheme (block sizes of three or six) without stratification to receive either durvalumab (1500 mg intravenously every 4 weeks for a maximum of 13 cycles) plus tremelimumab (75 mg intravenously every 4 weeks for a maximum of four cycles) alone or with low-dose (0·5 Gy delivered twice per day, repeated for 2 days during each of the first four cycles of therapy) or hypofractionated radiotherapy (24 Gy total delivered over three 8-Gy fractions during the first cycle only), 1 week after initial durvalumab-tremelimumab administration. Study treatment was continued until 1 year or until progression. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (best locally assessed confirmed response of a partial or complete response) and, along with safety, was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study therapy. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02888743, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between Aug 24, 2017, and March 29, 2019, 90 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, of whom 78 (26 per group) were treated. This trial was stopped due to futility assessed in an interim analysis. At a median follow-up of 12·4 months (IQR 7·8-15·1), there were no differences in overall response rates between the durvalumab-tremelimumab alone group (three [11·5%, 90% CI 1·2-21·8] of 26 patients) and the low-dose radiotherapy group (two [7·7%, 0·0-16·3] of 26 patients; p=0·64) or the hypofractionated radiotherapy group (three [11·5%, 1·2-21·8] of 26 patients; p=0·99). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dyspnoea (two [8%] in the durvalumab-tremelimumab alone group; three [12%] in the low-dose radiotherapy group; and three [12%] in the hypofractionated radiotherapy group) and hyponatraemia (one [4%] in the durvalumab-tremelimumab alone group vs two [8%] in the low-dose radiotherapy group vs three [12%] in the hypofractionated radiotherapy group). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in one (4%) patient in the durvalumab-tremelimumab alone group (maculopapular rash), five (19%) patients in the low-dose radiotherapy group (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, hypokalemia, and respiratory failure), and four (15%) patients in the hypofractionated group (adrenal insufficiency, colitis, diarrhoea, and hyponatremia). In the low-dose radiotherapy group, there was one death from respiratory failure potentially related to study therapy. INTERPRETATION: Radiotherapy did not increase responses to combined PD-L1 plus CTLA-4 inhibition in patients with NSCLC resistant to PD(L)-1 therapy. However, PD-L1 plus CTLA-4 therapy could be a treatment option for some patients. Future studies should refine predictive biomarkers in this setting.

MERTK inhibition may lower the threshold for immune activation thereby promoting anti-tumor activity. Agents with some degree of MERTK inhibitory activity have been investigated in the clinic, but are limited by poor potency in patients (pts) and significant off-targets effects. PF-07265807 (ARRY-067) is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of the TAMKs MERTK and AXL. In preclinical models, PF-07265807 monotherapy shows antitumor activity that results in long-term cures and resistance to tumor re-challenge when combined with anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) antibodies. This first-in-human study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of PF-07265807 in pts with selected advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study will also explore the potential utility of PF-07265807 in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. Methods: This is a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study (NCT04458259) to evaluate the safety, PK and tolerability of PF-07265807. Eligible participants will be adult pts with selected advanced or metastatic solid tumors who are intolerant or resistant to standard therapy. Other key eligibility criteria: measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 or non-measurable disease; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–2; adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function; and resolved acute effects of any prior therapy. Successive cohorts of pts will receive escalating doses of PF-07265807 starting from 25 mg QD. Each cycle will be 21 days in duration (14 days on/7 days off). Study drug treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. For dose escalation, a Bayesian logistic regression model will be used to model the relationship of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) to PF-07265807 dose. This model, along with escalation with overdose control, will guide the dose escalation of PF-07265807 after the completion of the DLT observation period (first two cycles of treatment, i.e. 42 days) of each cohort, until determination of the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D). After the MTD/RP2D is identified, the safety and efficacy of combined PF-07265807 and anti-PD1/PD-L1 treatment will be explored. Primary endpoints: incidence of DLTs, treatment-emergent adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. Secondary endpoints: PK parameters of PF-07265807, objective response rate and duration of response. The study began enrolling pts in September 2020 and is still recruiting.

We hypothesize that ibrutinib has a direct antitumor effect in melanoma cell lines and that treatment of metastatic melanomas with ibrutinib induces antitumor responses. METHODS: We assessed the ibrutinib effect on melanoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, and motility. Patients with metastatic melanoma refractory to PD-1 and MAPK inhibitors (if BRAFV600-mutant) were treated with ibrutinib, 840 mg PO QD, as part of a phase II clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02581930). RESULTS: Melanoma cell lines frequently express ITK, YES1, and EGFR. Ibrutinib suppressed cell motility and proliferation in most cell lines. Eighteen patients (13 male; median age 63.5 years, range 37-82; 12 with ipilimumab resistance) were enrolled. The most frequent side effects were fatigue (61%), anorexia (50%), hyponatremia (28%), nausea, and vomiting (22% each). No antitumor responses were seen. At a median follow-up of 6 months (0.3-35.8 months), the median progression-free survival was 1.3 months (range 0.2-5.5 months). Fifteen patients were discontinued from the study due to progression, and 14 patients had died from metastatic melanoma. All archived tumors expressed ITK, 41% had no expression of p16 and PTEN, and 61% had absent tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Ibrutinib significantly suppressed proliferating (Ki67+) CD19+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells and had no significant effect on other lymphocyte subsets. CONCLUSION: Ibrutinib did not induce any meaningful clinical benefit. ITK expression may not be clinically relevant. Treatment-refractory metastatic melanomas have other fundamental defects (i.e. absent PTEN and p16 expression, absent TILs) that may contribute to an adverse prognosis.",

However, effective therapeutic strategies by targeting RAS, in particular RASG12D and RASG12V, and associated downstream pathways have been so far unsuccessful. Treatment of oncogenic RAS-ravaged cancer patients remains a currently unmet clinical need. Consistent with a major role in cancer metabolism, oncogenic RAS activation elevates both reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity and ROS-scavenging glutathione biosynthesis. At a certain threshold, the heightened oxidative stress and antioxidant capability achieve a higher level of redox balance, on which cancer cells depend to gain a selective advantage on survival and proliferation. However, this prominent metabolic feature may irrevocably render cancer cells vulnerable to concurrent inhibition of both NOX activity and glutathione biosynthesis, which may be exploited as a novel therapeutic strategy. In this report, we test this hypothesis by treating the HRASG12V-transformed ovarian epithelial cells, mutant KRAS-harboring pancreatic and colon cancer cells of mouse and human origins, as well as cancer xenografts, with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) combination, which inhibit NOX activity and glutathione biosynthesis, respectively. Our results demonstrate that concomitant targeting of NOX and glutathione biosynthesis induces a highly potent lethality to cancer cells harboring oncogenic RAS. Therefore, our studies provide a novel strategy against RAS-bearing cancers that warrants further mechanistic and translational investigation.",

However, the effects of mutant KRAS alone do not recapitulate the full spectrum of pancreatic pathologies associated with PDAC development in adults. Historically, mutant KRAS was regarded as constitutively active; however, recent studies have shown that endogenous levels of mutant KRAS are not constitutively fully active and its activity is still subject to up-regulation by upstream stimuli. Obesity is a metabolic disease that induces a chronic, low-grade inflammation called meta-inflammation and has long been recognized clinically as a major modifiable risk factor for pancreatic cancer. It has been shown in different animal models that obesogenic high-fat diet (HFD) and pancreatic inflammation promote the rapid development of mutant KRAS-mediated PDAC with high penetrance. However, it is not clear why the pancreas with endogenous levels of mutant KRAS is vulnerable to chronic HFD and inflammatory challenges. Recently, the discovery of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a novel anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory factor and as a downstream target of mutant KRAS has shed new light on this problem. This review is intended to provide an update on our knowledge of the vulnerability of the pancreas to KRAS-mediated invasive PDAC in the context of challenges engendered by obesity and associated inflammation.",

                  "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma commonly presents as metastatic disease and harbors a dire prognosis due to its aggressive behavior, propensity for resistance to therapies, and lack of targetable driver mutations. Additionally, despite advances in other cancers, immunotherapy has been ineffective in this disease thus far and treatment remains centered around cytotoxic chemotherapy. Here, we present a case of a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring both high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and HER2 amplification. After an initial response to standard-of-care chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX followed by progression, she was treated with dual immune checkpoint blockade, which resulted in a period of disease control. This was complicated by the development of autoimmune hypophysitis and an incidental finding of brain metastasis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her extracranial disease progressed while receiving stereotactic radiosurgery, with findings of lymphangitic spread in her lungs, and her treatment was changed to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel with trastuzumab. This resulted in a degree of extracranial disease control, though she experienced progressive brain metastases despite radiation and therapeutic switch to lapatinib and trastuzumab. Ultimately, the patient developed leptomeningeal disease which was not controlled by intrathecal trastuzumab. Given the rarity of central nervous system metastasis, HER2 amplification, and MSI in pancreatic cancer, this patient's presentation represents a confluence of multiple unique features. This case highlights the clinical value of up-front next-generation sequencing in metastatic pancreatic cancer and the ability of pancreatic cancer with actionable molecular variants to develop atypical sites of disease and adaptive resistance.",

However, the volume and complexity of alterations uncovered through genomic profiling make it difficult for oncologists to choose the most appropriate therapy for their patients. Here, we present a solution to this problem, The Molecular Registry of Tumors (MRT) and our Molecular Tumor Board (MTB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: MRT is an internally developed system that aggregates and normalizes genomic profiling results from multiple sources. MRT serves as the foundation for our MTB, a team that reviews genomic results for all Duke University Health System cancer patients, provides notifications for targeted therapies, matches patients to biomarker-driven trials, and monitors the molecular landscape of tumors at our institution. RESULTS: Among 215 patients reviewed by our MTB over a 6-month period, we identified 176 alterations associated with therapeutic sensitivity, 15 resistance alterations, and 51 alterations with potential germline implications. Of reviewed patients, 17% were subsequently treated with a targeted therapy. For 12 molecular therapies approved during the course of this work, we identified between two and 71 patients who could qualify for treatment based on retrospective MRT data. An analysis of 14 biomarker-driven clinical trials found that MRT successfully identified 42% of patients who ultimately enrolled. Finally, an analysis of 4,130 comprehensive genomic profiles from 3,771 patients revealed that the frequency of clinically significant therapeutic alterations varied from approximately 20% to 70% depending on the tumor type and sequencing test used. CONCLUSION: With robust informatics tools, such as MRT, and the right MTB structure, a precision cancer medicine program can be developed, which provides great benefit to providers and patients with cancer.",

The aim of this study was to assess impact of delayed AC on overall survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Patients with stage I-III pancreatic head adenocarcinoma in the 2006-2015 National Cancer Database were grouped by timing of AC (<6-weeks, 6-12-weeks, and 12-24-weeks). Overall survival was compared using Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for patient, tumor, and hospital factors. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the impact of comorbidities, readmission or extended hospital stay, and receipt of single- versus multi-agent chemotherapy. RESULTS: Of 13438 patients, 4552 (33.9%) received no AC, 2112 (15.7%) received AC <6-weeks following resection, 5580 (41.5%) within 6-12 weeks, and 1194 (8.9%) within 12-24 weeks. AC was associated with improved overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] <6-weeks: 0.765, 6-12-weeks: 0.744, and 12-24-weeks: 0.736 (p < 0.001)). This survival advantage persisted for patients with comorbidities, those with postoperative complications, and in those receiving single- or multi-agent regimens. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with stage I-III pancreatic adenocarcinoma, receipt of AC is associated with improved overall survival, even if delayed up to 24-weeks.",

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was also performed for correlations between genotypes of the identified genetic variants and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of their genes by using available databases of the 1000 Genomes, TCGA, and GTEx projects. In the single-locus logistic regression analysis, we identified 1141 out of 17 532 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 112 PPAR pathway genes. Further multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three independent, potentially functional loci (rs12947620 in MED1, rs11079651 in PRKCA, and rs34367566 in PRKCB) for pancreatic cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI], [1.06-1.17], P = 5.46 × 10<sup>-5</sup> ; OR = 1.10, 95% CI, [1.04-1.15], P = 1.99 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ; and OR = 1.09, 95% CI, [1.04-1.14], P = 3.16 × 10<sup>-4</sup> , respectively) among 65 SNPs that passed multiple comparison correction by false discovery rate (< 0.2). When risk genotypes of these three SNPs were combined, carriers with 2 to 3 unfavorable genotypes (NUGs) had a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than those with 0 to 1 NUGs. The eQTL analysis showed that rs34367566 A>AG was associated with decreased expression levels of PRKCB mRNA in 373 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Our findings indicate that genetic variants of the PPAR pathway genes, particularly MED1, PRKCA, and PRKCB, may contribute to susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.",

In this Phase 2 study of ced/olap in women with relapsed ovarian cancer (NCT02345265), we observed an ORR of 74% with ced/olap in plat sensitive relapsed patients (pts) and an ORR of 20% in plat resistant pts. BROCA-HR was performed to characterize tumor HRD status and to correlate this with the activity of ced/olap in the plat sensitive and resistant settings. Methods: Pts with relapsed ovarian cancer across 11 centers were enrolled to 2 cohorts, either plat sensitive or resistant. All pts received ced 30mg daily and olap tablets 200mg BID. Archival, pre-treatment, and on-treatment biopsies were collected on all pts where safely feasible; pts also had the option of undergoing a post-progression biopsy. A baseline blood sample was collected for germline testing and matched control. Available samples were sequenced with BROCA-HR, and HRD status was determined by (1) presence of an HR-related mutation or (2) an increase in loss of heterozygosity (LOH) score. Results: 72 pts were enrolled, with 70 pts receiving study treatment (35 plat sensitive and 35 plat resistant). BROCA-HR analysis is complete on 60 samples, with 10 samples in final analysis. The concordance of HRD status by presence of an HR-related mutation or by LOH score was relatively low (agreement=36/60=60%, Cohen's Kappa=0.28). In 19 pts with a germline BRCA mutation, 16 were HRD+ by LOH (LOH high), 2 were HRD- by LOH (LOH low), and 1 not quantifiable. 3 pts had a somatic BRCA mutation; 1 was LOH high, 1 LOH low, and 1 not quantifiable. 4 pts had non-BRCA somatic HR-related mutations (3 CDK12; 1 ATR); 3 were LOH high and 1 LOH low. Of the 34 pts without HR-related mutations, 15 were LOH high, 16 were LOH low, and 3 not quantifiable. In 29 plat sensitive pts with BROCA-HR results, 18 were HRD+ by mutation (12 germline BRCA, 3 somatic BRCA, 3 somatic other), and 16 were HRD+ by LOH (LOH high). The ORR in plat sensitive pts by HRD status with available HRD results was: 22/29=75.9% (13/18=72% HRDmut+; 9/11=82% HRDmut-); (12/16=75% LOH high; 6/9= 67% LOH low). In 31 plat resistant pts with BROCA-HR results, 8 were HRD+ by mutation (7 germline BRCA, 0 somatic BRCA, 1 somatic other), and 19 were HRD+ by LOH. The ORR in plat resistant pts by HRD status with available HRD results was: 7/31=22.6% (4/8=50% HRDmut+; 3/23=13% HRDmut-, P=0.05); (7/19=37% LOH high; 0/11= 0% LOH low, P=0.03). Updated results with the full data set are pending. Conclusion: Ced/olap has clinical activity in women with relapsed ovarian cancer, both in the plat sensitive and plat resistant settings. In women with plat sensitive disease, where response rates are high, HRD status by presence of an HR-related mutation or LOH status does not appear to provide significant additional information regarding likelihood of response. In women with plat resistant disease, the presence of HRD by an HR-related mutation or LOH status is correlated with a higher likelihood of response.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Joyce F Liu, Su-Chun Cheng, Robert M Wenham, Andrea E Wahner Hendrickson, Deborah K Armstrong, Nancy Chan, David E Cohn, Jung-Min Lee, Richard T Penson, Mihaela Cristea, James Abbruzzese, Koji Matsuo, Alexander B Olawaiye, Jennifer Curtis, Geoffrey Shapiro, Ursula A Matulonis, Elise Kohn, Percy Ivy, Elizabeth M Swisher.

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obesity is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. In mice, a high-fat diet (HFD) and expression of oncogenic KRAS lead to development of invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by unknown mechanisms. We investigated how oncogenic KRAS regulates the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21, FGF21, a metabolic regulator that prevents obesity, and the effects of recombinant human FGF21 (rhFGF21) on pancreatic tumorigenesis. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical analyses of FGF21 levels in human pancreatic tissue arrays, comprising 59 PDAC specimens and 45 nontumor tissues. We also studied mice with tamoxifen-inducible expression of oncogenic KRAS in acinar cells (KrasG12D/+ mice) and fElasCreERT mice (controls). KrasG12D/+ mice were placed on an HFD or regular chow diet (control) and given injections of rhFGF21 or vehicle; pancreata were collected and analyzed by histology, immunoblots, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. We measured markers of inflammation in the pancreas, liver, and adipose tissue. Activity of RAS was measured based on the amount of bound guanosine triphosphate. RESULTS: Pancreatic tissues of mice expressed high levels of FGF21 compared with liver tissues. FGF21 and its receptor proteins were expressed by acinar cells. Acinar cells that expressed KrasG12D/+ had significantly lower expression of Fgf21 messenger RNA compared with acinar cells from control mice, partly due to down-regulation of PPARG expression-a transcription factor that activates Fgf21 transcription. Pancreata from KrasG12D/+ mice on a control diet and given injections of rhFGF21 had reduced pancreatic inflammation, infiltration by immune cells, and acinar-to-ductal metaplasia compared with mice given injections of vehicle. HFD-fed KrasG12D/+ mice given injections of vehicle accumulated abdominal fat, developed extensive inflammation, pancreatic cysts, and high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs); half the mice developed PDAC with liver metastases. HFD-fed KrasG12D/+ mice given injections of rhFGF21 had reduced accumulation of abdominal fat and pancreatic triglycerides, fewer pancreatic cysts, reduced systemic and pancreatic markers of inflammation, fewer PanINs, and longer survival-only approximately 12% of the mice developed PDACs, and none of the mice had metastases. Pancreata from HFD-fed KrasG12D/+ mice given injections of rhFGF21 had lower levels of active RAS than from mice given vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: Normal acinar cells from mice and humans express high levels of FGF21. In mice, acinar expression of oncogenic KRAS significantly reduces FGF21 expression. When these mice are placed on an HFD, they develop extensive inflammation, pancreatic cysts, PanINs, and PDACs, which are reduced by injection of FGF21. FGF21 also reduces the guanosine triphosphate binding capacity of RAS. FGF21 might be used in the prevention or treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

In the present study, we aimed to identify genetic variants of the LKB1-AMPK pathway genes and their associations with pancreatic cancer (PanC) risk using 15 418 participants of European ancestry from two previously published PanC genome-wide association studies. We found that six novel tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (i.e, MAP2 rs35075084 T > deletion, PRKAG2 rs2727572 C > T and rs34852782 A > deletion, TP53 rs9895829 A > G, and RPTOR rs62068300 G > A and rs3751936 G > C) were significantly associated with an increased PanC risk. The multivariate logistic regression model incorporating the number of unfavorable genotypes (NUGs) with adjustment for age and sex showed that carriers with five to six NUGs had an increased PanC risk (odds ratio = 1.24, 95% confidence interval = 1.16-1.32 and P < 0.0001), compared to those with zero to four NUGs. Subsequent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis further revealed that these SNPs were associated with significantly altered mRNA expression levels either in 373 normal lymphoblastoid cell lines (TP53 SNP rs9895829, P < 0.05) or in whole blood cells of 369 normal donors from the genotype-tissue expression project (GTEx) database [RPTOR SNP rs60268947 and rs28434589, both in high linkage disequilibrium (r2  > 0.9) withRPTOR rs62068300, P < 0.001]. Collectively, our findings suggest that these novel SNPs in the LKB1-AMPK pathway genes may modify susceptibility to PanC, possibly by influencing gene expression.",

We found that these three SNPs were associated with pancreatic cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.17 and P = 2.20E-06 for the rs3818626 C allele; OR = 0.76, CI = 0.66-0.88 and P = 1.46E-04 for the rs79447092 A allele and OR = 0.82, CI = 0.74-0.91 and P = 1.51E-04 for the rs9895829 G allele]. Their joint effect as the number of protective genotypes also showed a significant association with pancreatic cancer risk (trend test P ≤ 0.001). Finally, we performed an expression quantitative trait loci analysis and found that rs3818626 and rs9895829 were significantly associated with SMC2 and TP53 messenger RNA expression levels in 373 lymphoblastoid cell lines, respectively. In conclusion, these three representative SNPs may be potentially susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer and warrant additional validation.",

                  "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is one of the most lethal solid malignancies, and metastatic PanC is often present at the time of diagnosis. Although several high- and low-penetrance genes have been implicated in PanC, their roles in carcinogenesis remain only partially elucidated. Because the nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor2 (NRF2) signaling pathway is involved in human cancers, we hypothesize that genetic variants in NRF2 pathway genes are associated with PanC risk. To test this hypothesis, we assessed associations between 31 583 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 164 NRF2-related genes and PanC risk using three published genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets, which included 8474 cases and 6944 controls of European descent. We also carried out expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to assess the genotype-phenotype correlation of the identified significant SNP using publicly available data in the 1000 Genomes Project. We found that three novel SNP (ie, rs3124761, rs17458086 and rs1630747) were significantly associated with PanC risk (P = 5.17 × 10-7 , 5.61 × 10-4 and 5.52 × 10-4 , respectively). Combined analysis using the number of unfavorable genotypes (NUG) of these three SNP suggested that carriers of two to three NUG had an increased risk of PanC (P < 0.0001), compared with those carrying zero to one NUG. Furthermore, eQTL analysis showed that both rs3124761 T and rs17458086 C alleles were associated with increased mRNA expression levels of SLC2A6 and SLC2A13, respectively (P < 0.05). In conclusion, genetic variants in NRF2 pathway genes could play a role in susceptibility to PanC, and further functional exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms is warranted.",

Obesity driven by chronic consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) is a major risk factor for oncogenic KRAS-mediated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the role of HFD in KRAS-mediated metabolic reprogramming has been obscure. Here, by using genetically engineered mouse models expressing an endogenous level of KRASG12D in pancreatic acinar cells, we demonstrate that hyperactivation of KRASG12D by obesogenic HFD, as compared to carbohydrate-rich diet, is responsible for enhanced aerobic glycolysis that associates with critical pathogenic responses in the path towards PDAC. Ablation of Cox-2 attenuates KRAS hyperactivation leading to the reversal of both aggravated aerobic glycolysis and high-grade dysplasia under HFD challenge. Our data highlight a pivotal role of the cooperative interaction between obesity-ensuing HFD and oncogenic KRAS in driving the heightened aerobic glycolysis during pancreatic tumorigenesis and suggest that in addition to directly targeting KRAS and aerobic glycolysis pathway, strategies to target the upstream of KRAS hyperactivation may bear important therapeutic value.",

Among the different subtypes, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. The genetic landscape of PDAC shows nearly ubiquitous mutations of KRAS. However, expression of KRAS somatic mutants alone is insufficient to drive PDAC. Redox deregulation may contribute significantly to KRAS-mediated PDAC. Thus, measurement of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels is essential to determine how oxidative stress affects mutant KRAS and modulates intracellular signaling pathways leading to the change of cellular functions and the development of PDAC. Here we describe the protocol for comparative measurement of several key forms of ROS, including intracellular and mitochondrial levels of superoxide as well as extracellular H2O2 and general cellular ROS, with oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probes using flow cytometry in pancreatic cancer cells or mutant KRAS transformed cells.",

The past two decades have seen significant change in our approach to CUP patients. Therapy strategies have moved away from the empiric combination cytotoxic therapies and the “one treatment fits all” approach. The primary focus has been on improved methods to identify the putative primary tumor and to direct therapy at that tumor type. Albeit not uniform, there is consensus that the evaluation needs to be focused, with imaging and invasive tests based on symptomatology and pathologic evaluation. Although it has limitations including variable tissue antigenicity and interpretation, immunohistochemistry remains a powerful tool in the judicious pathologic assessment of metastatic tumor tissue. Over the last several years, cancer classifying tissue of origin profiling libraries has generated enormous data, analyses of which have led to additional insights. Using next generation sequencing, there is a push toward personalizing cancer care through the use of genomic tools to identify driver and actionable mutations in individual tumors. For this approach to be successful in CUP, it will require continued understanding of unique molecular insights for select CUP subsets, as well as leveraging novel drugs that are effective against specific mutations in known cancers.",

Sp1 is a negative prognostic factor for pancreatic, colon, glioma, gastric, breast, prostate, and lung cancer patients. Functional studies also demonstrate that Sp TFs regulate genes responsible for cancer cell growth, survival, migration/invasion, inflammation and drug resistance, and Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are also nononcogene addiction (NOA) genes and important drug targets. The mechanisms of drug-induced downregulation of Sp TFs and pro-oncogenic Sp-regulated genes are complex and include ROS-dependent epigenetic pathways that initially decrease expression of the oncogene cMyc. Many compounds such as curcumin, aspirin, and metformin that are active in cancer prevention also exhibit chemotherapeutic activity and these compounds downregulate Sp TFs in cancer cell lines and tumors. The effects of these compounds on downregulation of Sp TFs in normal cells and the contribution of this response to their chemopreventive activity have not yet been determined.

Recently, improved overall survival has been achieved with cytotoxic drug combinations including 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, but the success has been modest at best. More targeted approaches focusing on EGFR and MAPK signaling have also enjoyed marginal success. Accumulating evidence suggests that pancreatic tumors have increased dependence on metabolic pathways through both KRAS and KRAS-independent mechanisms and are broadly resistant to drug therapy due to stromal remodeling. Genetic and epigenetic vulnerabilities, such as inactivating aberrations in DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling, and microRNA dysregulation, may reveal exploitable weaknesses. Modern approaches to drug development tailored to molecularly defined subsets of patients likely to respond to targeted therapies are needed to achieve more substantial progress in this disease in an era of precision medicine.",

In our study, we aimed to identify genetic variants of the PDGF pathway genes associated with pancreatic cancer (PC) risk in European populations using three published genome-wide association study datasets, which consisted of 9,381 cases and 7,719 controls. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was also performed using data from the 1000 Genomes, TCGA and GTEx projects. As a result, we identified two potential susceptibility loci (rs5757573 and rs6001516) of PDGFB associated with PC risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.16, and p = 4.70 × 10-5 for the rs5757573 C allele and 1.21, 1.11-1.32, and 2.01 × 10-5 for the rs6001516 T allele]. Haplotype analysis revealed that the C-T haplotype carriers had a significantly increased risk of PC than those carrying the T-C haplotype (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.12-1.34, p =5.00 × 10-6 ). The multivariate regression model incorporating the number of unfavorable genotypes (NUGs) with age and sex showed that carriers with 1-2 NUGs, particularly among 60-70 age group or males, had an increased risk of PC, compared to those without NUG. Furthermore, the eQTL analysis revealed that both loci were correlated with a decreased mRNA expression level of PDGFB in lymphoblastoid cell lines and pancreatic tumor tissues (p = 0.015 and 0.071, respectively). Our results suggest that genetic variants in PDGFB may play a role in susceptibility to PC. Further population and functional validations of our findings are warranted.",

Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). METHODS: Patients with R0/R1 resection were randomized 1:1 to cetuximab or bevacizumab administered in combination with gemcitabine for two treatment cycles. Next three cycles included concurrent cetuximab/bevacizumab plus chemoradiation, followed by one cycle of cetuximab/bevacizumab. Cycles 7-12 included cetuximab/bevacizumab with gemcitabine. Cycles were 2 weeks. Frequency of specific toxicities was summarized for each treatment arm at two times during the study, after chemotherapy but prior to chemoradiation and after all therapy. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients were randomized (A, n = 65; B, n = 62). Prior to chemoradiation, the overall rate for toxicities of interest was 10% for arm A and 2% for arm B. After all therapy, the overall rates for toxicities of interest were 30 and 25% for arms A and B, respectively. Overall median OS and DFS were 17 and 11 months, respectively, which is not a significant improvement over expected survival rates for historical controls. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments were tolerable with manageable toxicities, and were safe enough for a phase III trial had this been indicated.",

METHODS: Candidate biomarkers were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based sequential validation using independent multiple sample cohorts consisting of PDAC cases (n = 187), benign pancreatic disease (n = 93), and healthy controls (n = 169). A biomarker panel for early-stage PDAC was developed based on a logistic regression model. All statistical tests for the results presented below were one-sided.

METHODS: Consecutive patients (622) with PDAC who underwent PD following chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation between 1990 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative treatment regimens, clinicopathologic characteristics, operative details, and long-term outcomes in four successive time periods (1990-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014) were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: The average number of patients per year who underwent PD following preoperative therapy as well as the proportion of operations performed for borderline resectable and locally advanced (BR/LA) tumors increased over time. The use of induction systemic chemotherapy, as well as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, also increased over time. Throughout the study period, the mean EBL decreased while R0 margin rates and vascular resection rates increased overall. Despite the increase in BR/LA resections, locoregional recurrence (LR) rates remained similar over time, and overall survival (OS) improved significantly (median 24.1, 28.1, 37.3, 43.4 months, respectively, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite increases in case complexity, relatively low rates of LR have been maintained while significant improvements in OS have been observed. Further improvements in patient outcomes will likely require disruptive advances in systemic therapy.",

Because lipid droplet is the organelle responsible for storing lipid energy in adipocytes, it is the plausible target of FGF21 action. However, the impact of the FGF21-βKlotho-FGFR1 signaling pathway on the functions of the lipid droplet is not clearly understood. Using our mouse models of adipocyte-specific FGFR1 ablation and hepatic overexpression of FGF21 with diet-induced obesity established previously, we analyzed the alterations of the pathways involved in energy and substrate metabolism that is attributable to the dynamic functions of the lipid droplet. In addition to the previous reports showing that FGFR1 deficiency abrogated lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and energy expenditure promoted by the elevated FGF21 signal, we observed that the deficiency up-regulated the biosynthesis and remodeling of membrane phospholipids that are important for the biogenesis and expansion of the droplet, whereas the enhanced FGF21 signal constrained the biosynthesis of phospholipids. As a result, the loss of adipose FGFR1 led to a sustained droplet expansion and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, whereas the enhanced FGF21 signal suppressed them in obesogenesis. These new findings reveal that the FGF21-βKlotho-FGFR1 signaling axis plays roles in maintaining phospholipid homeostasis and the dynamic functions of the lipid droplet, whereas protecting against ER stress, and suggest a potential link of phospholipid biosynthesis, lipid droplet dynamics, ER stress, and energy homeostasis in adipose tissue coordinated by this signaling axis.",

We developed a method to capture and characterize circulating tumor cells (CTC) expressing c-MET using a ferromagnetic antibody. Immunofluorescence was used to characterize cells for c-MET, DAPI, and pan-CK, excluding CD45(+) leukocytes. The assay was validated using appropriate cell line controls spiked into peripheral blood collected from healthy volunteers (HV). In addition, peripheral blood was analyzed from patients with metastatic gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, bladder, renal, or prostate cancers. CTCs captured by c-MET were enumerated, and DNA FISH for MET amplification was performed. The approach was highly sensitive (80%) for MET-amplified cells, sensitive (40%-80%) for c-MET-overexpressed cells, and specific (100%) for both c-MET-negative cells and in 20 HVs. Of 52 patients with metastatic carcinomas tested, c-MET CTCs were captured in replicate samples from 3 patients [gastric, colorectal, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC)] with 6% prevalence. CTC FISH demonstrated that MET amplification in both gastric and colorectal cancer patients and trisomy 7 with gain of MET gene copies in the RCC patient. The c-MET CTC assay is a rapid, noninvasive, sensitive, and specific method for detecting MET-amplified tumor cells. CTCs with MET amplification can be detected in patients with gastric, colorectal, and renal cancers. IMPLICATIONS: This study developed a novel c-MET CTC assay for detecting c-MET CTCs in patients with MET amplification and warrants further investigation to determine its clinical applicability.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with 5-fluorouracil-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer at the MD Anderson Cancer Center were offered screening in the Assessment of Targeted Therapies Against Colorectal Cancer (ATTACC) program to identify eligibility for companion phase I or II clinical trials with a therapy targeted to an aberration detected in the patient, based on testing by immunohistochemistry, targeted gene sequencing panels, and CpG island methylation phenotype assays. RESULTS: Between August 2010 and December 2013, 484 patients were enrolled, 458 (95%) had a biomarker result, and 157 (32%) were enrolled on a clinical trial (92 on biomarker-selected and 65 on nonbiomarker selected). Of the 458 patients with a biomarker result, enrollment on biomarker-selected clinical trials was ninefold higher for predefined ATTACC-companion clinical trials as opposed to nonpredefined biomarker-selected clinical trials, 17.9% versus 2%, P < 0.001. Factors that correlated positively with trial enrollment in multivariate analysis were higher performance status, older age, lack of standard of care therapy, established patient at MD Anderson, and the presence of an eligible biomarker for an ATTACC-companion study. Early molecular screening did result in a higher rate of patients with remaining standard of care therapy enrolling on ATTACC-companion clinical trials, 45.1%, in contrast to nonpredefined clinical trials, 22.7%; odds ratio 3.1, P = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS: Though early molecular prescreening for predefined clinical trials resulted in an increase rate of trial enrollment of nonrefractory patients, the majority of patients enrolled on clinical trials were refractory to standard of care therapy. Within molecular prescreening programs, tailoring screening for preidentified and open clinical trials, temporally linking screening to treatment and optimizing both patient and physician engagement are efforts likely to improve enrollment on biomarker-selected clinical trials.

Weight loss due to fat and muscle depletion is a hallmark of pancreatic cancer and is associated with worse outcomes. Studies of curcumin's effects on muscularity show conflicting results in animal models. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective matched 1:2 case-control study to evaluate the effects of curcumin on body composition (determined by computerized tomography) of 66 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (22 treated,44 controls). Average age (SEM) was 63(1.8) years, 30/66(45%) women, median number of prior therapies was 2, median (IQR) time from advanced pancreatic cancer diagnosis to baseline image was 7(2-13.5) months (p>0.2, all variables). All patients lost weight (3.3% and 1.3%, treated vs. control, p=0.13). Treated patients lost more muscle (median [IQR] percent change -4.8[-9.1,-0.1] vs. -0.05%[-4.2, 2.6] in controls,p<0.001) and fat (median [IQR] percent change -6.8%[-15,-0.6] vs. -4.0%[-7.6, 1.3] in controls,p=0.04). Subcutaneous fat was more affected in the treated patients. Sarcopenic patients treated with curcumin(n=15) had survival of 169(115-223) days vs. 299(229-369) sarcopenic controls(p=0.024). No survival difference was found amongst non-sarcopenic patients.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were selected, according to tissue availability, from eligible patients with resected pancreatic cancer who were enrolled on the NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9704 trial of 5-fluorouacil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation preceded and followed by 5-FU or gemcitabine. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue sections, and genotype was determined using the Taqman method. The correlation between genotype and overall survival was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: In the 154 of the study's 451 eligible patients with evaluable tissue, genotype distribution followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (ie, 37% had genotype AA, 43% AC, and 20% CC). The RECQ1 variant AC/CC genotype carriers were associated with being node positive compared with the AA carrier (P=.03). The median survival times (95% confidence interval [CI]) for AA, AC, and CC carriers were 20.6 (16.3-26.1), 18.8 (14.2-21.6), and 14.2 (10.3-21.0) months, respectively. On multivariate analysis, patients with the AC/CC genotypes were associated with worse survival than patients with the AA genotype (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.23, P=.022). This result seemed slightly stronger for patients on the 5-FU arm (n=82) (HR 1.64, 95% CI 0.99-2.70, P=.055) than for patients on the gemcitabine arm (n=72, HR 1.46, 95% CI 0.81-2.63, P=.21). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that the RECQ1 A159C genotype may be a prognostic or predictive factor for resectable pancreatic cancer patients who are treated with adjuvant 5-FU before and after 5-FU-based chemoradiation. Further study is needed in patients treated with gemcitabine to determine whether an association exists.",

In 2015, it is estimated that there will be 48,960 new cases of pancreatic cancer and that 40,560 people will die of the disease. The 5-year survival rate is 7.2% for all patients with pancreatic cancer; however, survival depends greatly on the stage at diagnosis. Unfortunately, 53% of patients already have metastatic disease at diagnosis, which corresponds to a 5-year survival rate of 2.4%. Even for the 9% of patients with localized disease confined to the pancreas, the 5-year survival is still modest at only 27.1%. These grim statistics highlight the need for ways to identify cohorts of individuals at highest risk, methods to screen those at highest risk to identify preinvasive pathologic precursors, and development of effective systemic therapies. Recent clinical and translational progress has emphasized the relationship with diabetes, the role of the stroma, and the interplay of each of these with inflammation in the pathobiology of pancreatic cancer. In this article, we will discuss these relationships and how they might translate into novel management strategies for the treatment of this disease.",

However, limited information is available on how this initiative effected transparency and selective reporting of clinical trial data. METHODS: We analyzed 74 oncology-based randomized trials published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, the New England Journal of Medicine, and The Lancet in 2012. To ascertain integrity of reporting, we compared published reports with their respective appended protocols with regard to primary end points, nonprimary end points, unplanned end points, and unplanned analyses. RESULTS: A total of 86 primary end points were reported in 74 randomized trials; nine trials had greater than one primary end point. Nine trials (12.2%) had some discrepancy between their planned and published primary end points. A total of 579 nonprimary end points (median, seven per trial) were planned, of which 373 (64.4%; median, five per trial) were reported. A significant positive correlation was found between the number of planned and nonreported nonprimary end points (Spearman r = 0.66; P < .001). Twenty-eight studies (37.8%) reported a total of 65 unplanned end points; 52 (80.0%) of which were not identified as unplanned. Thirty-one (41.9%) and 19 (25.7%) of 74 trials reported a total of 52 unplanned analyses involving primary end points and 33 unplanned analyses involving nonprimary end points, respectively. Studies reported positive unplanned end points and unplanned analyses more frequently than negative outcomes in abstracts (unplanned end points odds ratio, 6.8; P = .002; unplanned analyses odd ratio, 8.4; P = .007).

The aim of the study is to demonstrate the associations between ABO blood type and other clinical factors with the risk of thromboembolism (TE) in patients with PC. We conducted a retrospective study in 670 patients with pathologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Clinical information was retrieved from medical records. ABO blood type was determined serologically and/or genetically. Logistic regression models, Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed in data analysis. The incidence of TE was 35.2% in 670 patients who did not have TE prior to cancer diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) consisted 44.1% of the TE events. Non-O blood type, pancreatic body/tail tumors, previous use of antithrombotic medication, and obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m(2) ) were significant predictors for TE in general. Blood type A and AB, low hemoglobin level (≤ 10 g/dL), obesity, metastatic tumor, and pancreatic body/tail tumors were significant predictors for PE and DVT. Patients with metastatic tumor or pancreatic body/tail tumors had a much higher frequency of early TE events (≤ 3 months after cancer diagnosis); and early TE occurrence was a significant independent predictor for increased risk of death. These observations suggest that ABO non-O blood type is an independent predictor for TE in PC. A better understanding of the risk factors for TE in PC may help to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.",

KRAS represents one such target. Activating mutations, found in the majority of pancreatic cancer, activate downstream activators including RAF, MEK, and ERK, and the hedgehog pathway. The PI3 kinase pathway is also frequently activated through the disruption of the PTEN tumor pathway, in turn activating NF-kB and C-MYC. Likewise, the TGF-β pathway acts through SMAD dependent and independent pathways to control MYC expression, affect epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and modify the immune response. Activation of the Notch pathway receptors has also been shown to regulate cell cycle effectors. DNA repair abnormalities may play a role in the rise of pancreatic cancer; these also have implications for treatment. Finally, immunotherapeutic agents are now being developed for use in pancreatic cancer and other treatments. In this chapter, we review each of these molecular pathways and discuss their applicability to pancreatic cancer treatment.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is considered a uniformly fatal disease with a median survival of 1 year with modern chemotherapy. While a subset of patients achieve prolonged survival, few of the factors that define this group of patients are known. METHODS: For the determination of overall survival (OS), 549 patients with histologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma were evaluated. Emphasis was placed on treatment history and family history of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. To ensure a uniform metastatic population, patients treated with prior locoregional therapies (i.e., surgery or radiotherapy) were excluded as were patients with a prior history of stage I-III disease. RESULTS: Patients with family history or pedigree history of cancer had superior OS. This was especially true in patients with three or more relatives with either breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancers [hazard ratio (HR) 0.49, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.80, p = 0.003]. First-line platinum chemotherapy was associated with a poor survival (hazard ratio for death 1.74, 95% CI 1.12-2.71, p = 0.01) for patients without a family history of these cancers but not for those without such a history (p = 0.31). In fact, as the number of relatives with these cancers increased, the OS survival improved for individuals receiving first-line platinum therapy (HR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.65-0.89, p = 0.0004), which was not the case for those receiving other therapies (p = 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with platinum chemotherapy in patients with a family history of breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancers was associated with a longer survival, whereas platinum use in patients without such a family history of cancer was associated with poor survival. These findings suggest that family history may serve as a predictive marker for platinum use in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",

Increased Src activity has been shown to correlate with disease progression and poor prognosis, suggesting Src could serve as a therapeutic target for kinase inhibition. Saracatinib (AZD0530) is a novel selective oral Src kinase inhibitor. METHODS: Metastatic colorectal cancer patients who had received one prior treatment and had measurable disease were enrolled in this phase 2 study. Saracatinib was administered at 175 mg by mouth daily for 28 day cycles until dose-limiting toxicity or progression as determined by staging every 2 cycles. The primary endpoint was improvement in 4 month progression-free survival. Design of Thall, Simon, and Estey was used to monitor proportion of patients that were progression free at 4 months. The trial was opened with plan to enroll maximum of 35 patients, with futility assessment every 10 patients. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients were enrolled between January and November 2007. Further enrollment was stopped due to futility. Median progression-free survival was 7.9 weeks, with all 10 patients showing disease progression following radiographic imaging. Median overall survival was 13.5 months. All patients were deceased by time of analysis. Observed adverse events were notable for a higher than expected number of patients with grade 3 hypophosphatemia (n = 5). CONCLUSION: Saracatinib is a novel oral Src kinase inhibitor that was well tolerated but failed to meet its primary endpoint of improvement in 4 month progression-free survival as a single agent in previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer patients.",

However, expression of mutant Kras alone is not sufficient to drive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in adult mice. Obesity is a metabolic disorder and is a risk factor for PDAC. One of the main factors that contributes to the development of obesity is high-fat consumption. Recent studies have demonstrated that High-Fat-Diet (HFD) can promote oncogenic Kras mediated development of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PDAC. However, it is not clear why mice with oncogenic KrasG12D expression are predisposed to HFD mediated pancreatic carcinogenesis. Here, we report that Ras activity dramatically reduces the expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). FGF21 is a key mediator of fatty acid oxidation and lipid metabolism. Pharmacological doses of FGF21 lower serum free fatty acids and lead to weight loss in obese mice. FGF21 is highly expressed in pancreatic acinar cells and is a potential autocrine factor. High levels expression of FGFR1 and β-Klotho, key components for specific sites of FGF21 action, were observed on normal control mouse pancreatic acinar cells using both qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry technics. FGF21 levels were dramatically reduced (∼6-fold) by Cre-mediated knock-in of oncogenic KrasG12D within one week and further decreased by more than 100-fold within 7 months. This effect of KrasG12D may have been mediated by decreased expression of pancreatic transcription factor Mist1, which was also observed. To dissect obesity and oncogenic KrasG12D mediated PDAC, we fed adult KrasG12D expressing mice with HFD or HFD+FGF21. We observed that KrasG12D expressing mice fed with HFD+FGF21 for 9 weeks significantly lower body weight and pancreatic triglyceride, as well as dramatically fewer PanIN lesions and tumor, compared with KrasG12D mice on a HFD without FGF21. FGF21 treatment extended survival of KrasG12D expressing mice on a HFD. Our results suggest that pancreas-derived FGF21 is an important metabolic regulator which is silenced by oncogenic KrasG12D expression and plays an important role in preventing HFD induced PDAC in KrasG12D expressing mice.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Weiqin Lu, Yaying Yang, Xiaojie Wang, Yan Liu, Yongde Luo, Robert A.

Cyclopamine (CPA), a potent inhibitor for sonic hedgehog pathway (SHH), shows great promises in PDAC treatment, including the disruption of tumor-associated stroma, and enhancement of radiation therapy. However, CPA is insoluble in water and therefore requires a nanometric delivery platform to achieve satisfactory performance. We herein encapsulated CPA in a core-cross-linked polymeric micelle system (M-CPA). M-CPA was combined with Cs-137 radiation and evaluated in vitro in PDAC cell lines and a human pancreatic stellate cell line. The results showed that M-CPA had higher cytotoxicity than CPA, abolished Gli-1 expression (a key component of SHH), and enhanced the radiation therapy of Cs-137. M-CPA radiosensitization correlated with its ability to disrupt the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage. These findings indicate that the combination therapy of M-CPA and radiation is an effective strategy to simultaneously treat pancreatic tumors and tumor-associated stroma.",

This study is aimed to demonstrate the impact of diabetes on clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer. Clinical and epidemiological information was collected from medical records or by personal interview in 1328 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Diabetes was defined by a known medical history, or abnormal fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c levels within three months of the cancer diagnosis. Duration of ≤3 years was used as the cutoff to arbitrarily define the new-onset and long-term diabetes. Logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test and Cox regression models were employed in the data analysis. Elevated level of FBG or HbA1c was observed in 24.7% and 11.5% of the patients without a known diabetes history, respectively. The prevalence of DM was 44.4% and was comparable by strata of tumor stage. New-onset diabetes was a significant independent predictor for risk of death in metastatic patients (HR=1.35, 95% CI=1.11-1.63, P=0.002) and in all patients (HR=1.23, 95% CI=1.09-1.40, P=0.001). Both new-onset and long term diabetes were significantly associated with older age, obesity, hypertension and coronary artery disease as well as weight loss. New-onset diabetes was also significantly related to larger tumors and elevated level of CA19-9 but not to tumor site and presence of biliary obstruction. Diabetes in general and new-onset diabetes in particular, is associated with poor outcome of pancreatic cancer. New-onset and long-term diabetes share common risk factors for type 2 diabetes.",

                  "abstract": "There is substantial heterogeneity in the clinical behavior of pancreatic cancer and in its response to therapy. Some of this variation may be due to differences in delivery of cytotoxic therapies between patients and within individual tumors. Indeed, in 12 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, we previously demonstrated wide inter-patient variability in the delivery of gemcitabine as well as in the mass transport properties of tumors as measured by computed tomography (CT) scans. However, the variability of drug delivery and transport properties within pancreatic tumors is currently unknown. Here, we analyzed regional measurements of gemcitabine DNA incorporation in the tumors of the same 12 patients to understand the degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity of drug delivery. We also developed a volumetric segmentation approach to measure mass transport properties from the CT scans of these patients and tested inter-observer agreement with this new methodology. Our results demonstrate significant heterogeneity of gemcitabine delivery within individual pancreatic tumors and across the patient cohort, with gemcitabine DNA incorporation in the inner portion of the tumors ranging from 38 to 74% of the total. Similarly, the CT-derived mass transport properties of the tumors had a high degree of heterogeneity, ranging from minimal difference to almost 200% difference between inner and outer portions of the tumor. Our quantitative method to derive transport properties from CT scans demonstrated less than 5% difference in gemcitabine prediction at the average CT-derived transport value across observers. These data illustrate significant inter-patient and intra-tumoral heterogeneity in the delivery of gemcitabine, and highlight how this variability can be reproducibly accounted for using principles of mass transport. With further validation as a biophysical marker, transport properties of tumors may be useful in patient selection for therapy and prediction of therapeutic outcome.",

Despite significant improvements in medical and surgical oncology and postoperative mortality rate, the overall survival for patients with pancreatic cancer has not changed significantly in the last four decades. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (NCT) is increasingly used to treat patients with potentially resectable PDAC, especially for patients with borderline resectable disease. However, analysis of prognostic factors is limited for patients with PDAC treated with NCT and pancreaticoduodenectomy. We systemically examined the pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens from 240 consecutive patients with PDAC who received NCT and pancreaticoduodenectomy between 1999 and 2007 at our institution. We found that posttreatment pathologic stage, pathologic tumor response grading, tumor involvement of the superior mesenteric/portal vein, tumor invasion into the muscular vessels, and perineural invasion are significant prognostic factors in our patient population. Therefore careful pathologic evaluation of the pancreatectomy specimens plays a key role in predicting prognosis of patients with PDAC who received NCT and pancreaticoduodenectomy.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score is the standard tool to assess hepatic reserve in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and CTP-A is the classic group for active therapy. However, CTP stratification accuracy has been questioned. We hypothesized that plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a valid surrogate for hepatic reserve to replace the subjective parameters in CTP score to improve its prognostic accuracy. METHODS: We retrospectively tested plasma IGF-1 levels in the training set (n = 310) from MD Anderson Cancer Center. Recursive partitioning identified three optimal IGF-1 ranges that correlated with overall survival (OS): greater than 50 ng/mL = 1 point; 26 to 50 ng/mL = 2 points; and less than 26 ng/mL = 3 points. We modified the CTP score by replacing ascites and encephalopathy grading with plasma IGF-1 value (IGF-CTP) and subjected both scores to log-rank analysis. Harrell's C-index and U-statistics were used to compare the prognostic performance of both scores in both the training and validation cohorts (n = 155). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Patients' stratification was statistically significantly stronger for IGF-CTP than CTP score for the training (P = .003) and the validation cohort (P = .005). Patients reclassified by IGF-CTP relative to their original CTP score were better stratified by their new risk groups. Most important, patients classified as A by CTP but B by IGF-CTP had statistically significantly worse OS than those who remained under class A by IGF-CTP in both cohorts (P = .03 and P < .001, respectively, from Cox regression models). AB patients had a worse OS than AA patients in both the training and validation set (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03 to 2.04, P = .03; HR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.65 to 4.85, P < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The IGF-CTP score is simple, blood-based, and cost-effective, stratified HCC better than CTP score, and validated well on two independent cohorts.

The objective of this study is to examine the expression of p53, p21, cyclin D1, and Bcl2 and their clinical significance in patients with AA. Tissue microarrays were constructed using archival tissue from 92 patients with AA who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at our institution. Each tumor was sampled in triplicate with a 1.0-mm punch from representative areas. The expression of p53, p21, cyclin D1, and Bcl2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and the staining results were correlated with clinicopathological features and survival. Among 92 cases studied, overexpression of p53, p21, cyclin D1, and Bcl2 was observed in 58.7%, 39.2%, 71.7%, and 5.4% of tumors, respectively. Patients whose tumor showed high level of cyclin D1 expression had higher risk of disease recurrence (P = .02) and worse recurrence-free and overall survivals after pancreaticoduodenectomy than did those with no or low cyclin D1 expression (P = .027 and P = .02, respectively). In multivariate analysis, cyclin D1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for both recurrence-free and overall survival (P < .05). However, there was no significant correlation between p53, p21, or Bcl2 expression and survival (P > .05). Our study showed that p53, p21, and cyclin D1, but not Bcl2, are frequently overexpressed in AAs. Cyclin D1 overexpression is associated with increased risk of disease recurrence and worse survival in patients with AA after resection.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The therapeutic resistance of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is partly ascribed to ineffective delivery of chemotherapy to cancer cells. We hypothesized that physical properties at vascular, extracellular, and cellular scales influence delivery of and response to gemcitabine-based therapy. METHODS: We developed a method to measure mass transport properties during routine contrast-enhanced CT scans of individual human PDAC tumors. Additionally, we evaluated gemcitabine infusion during PDAC resection in 12 patients, measuring gemcitabine incorporation into tumor DNA and correlating its uptake with human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1) levels, stromal reaction, and CT-derived mass transport properties. We also studied associations between CT-derived transport properties and clinical outcomes in patients who received preoperative gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy for resectable PDAC. RESULTS: Transport modeling of 176 CT scans illustrated striking differences in transport properties between normal pancreas and tumor, with a wide array of enhancement profiles. Reflecting the interpatient differences in contrast enhancement, resected tumors exhibited dramatic differences in gemcitabine DNA incorporation, despite similar intravascular pharmacokinetics. Gemcitabine incorporation into tumor DNA was inversely related to CT-derived transport parameters and PDAC stromal score, after accounting for hENT1 levels. Moreover, stromal score directly correlated with CT-derived parameters. Among 110 patients who received preoperative gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy, CT-derived parameters correlated with pathological response and survival. CONCLUSION: Gemcitabine incorporation into tumor DNA is highly variable and correlates with multiscale transport properties that can be derived from routine CT scans. Furthermore, pretherapy CT-derived properties correlate with clinically relevant endpoints. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01276613.

SOX9 expression was lower in PanIN2 and PanIN3 than in PanIN1 lesions (P < .01). Compared with BP, IPMN had lower SOX9 expression (P < .05). No correlation between SOX9 expression and other clinicopathologic parameters was identified. Our study showed that SOX9 is expressed in centroacinar and ductal epithelial cells of BP and is a useful marker for pancreatic ductal lineage of pancreatic neoplasms.",

However, the mechanism of HPK1 loss has not been defined. The aims of this study are to identify the ubiquitin ligase and to examine the mechanisms that targets HPK1 degradation. We found that the CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase targeted HPK1 for degradation via the 26 S proteasome. The ubiquitination of HPK1 required its kinase activity and autophosphorylation. Wild-type protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), but not the phosphatase-dead PP4 mutant, PP4-RL, inhibits the interaction of Fbxw8 with HPK1 and Fbxw8-mediated ubiquitination of HPK1. In addition, we showed that Thr-355 of HPK1 is a key PP4 dephosphorylation site, through which CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase and PP4 regulates HPK1 stability. Knockdown of Fbxw8 restores endogenous HPK1 protein expression and inhibits cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that targeted degradation of HPK1 by the CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase constitutes a negative-feedback loop to restrain the activity of HPK1 and that CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase promotes pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase-mediated HPK1 degradation revealed a direct link and novel role of CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase in the MAPK pathway, which plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation.",

Although the clinicopathologic features associated with aggressive SPNs have been reported, important prognostic factors of survival remain unclear. We systematically reviewed 64 cases of SPN resected at our institution for tumor size, extent of invasion, margin status, presence of lymphovascular, muscular vessel, and perineural invasion, and lymph node and distant metastases. Clinicopathologic characteristics were correlated with the presence of metastasis/recurrence and disease-specific survival. Five (8%) patients presented with stage IV disease. During follow-up, 5 (13%) of 39 patients with stage I-II disease had recurrences. Patients with metastatic/recurrent SPNs had significantly larger tumor size (P<0.001) and more frequent tumor invasion into muscular vessels (P=0.02). In a median follow-up of 76 months, only 2 died of disease (1 who presented with extensive peritoneal tumor involvement who died 2.5 mo after surgery, and 1 unusual case who presented with multiple liver metastasis and peritoneal seeding who died 19 mo after surgery), and 5 were alive with disease. The 10-year disease-specific survival rate was 96%. Muscular vessel invasion (P=0.001), tumor (T) stage by European Neuroendocrine Tumors Society (ENETS) classification (P<0.001), ENETS stage grouping (P<0.001), and stage grouping by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC stage, P<0.001) were important predictors of disease-specific survival in patients with SPN. Our study highlights the importance of pathologic evaluation in risk assessment in patients with SPNs.",

Given the recent change in prevalence of viral hepatitis and cirrhosis at oncology centers, which has altered the natural history of HCC, we aimed at comparing the accuracy of HCC staging systems in patients with or without hepatitis and cirrhosis. METHODS: A total of 438 patients were enrolled. Baseline clinicopathologic parameters, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score, TNM (6th edition) stage, Okuda stage, and Chinese University Prognostic Index score were prospectively obtained for all patients, and retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine overall survival (OS), Cox regression analyses were performed, and Harrell's Correspondence Index compared the staging systems' ability to predict OS duration. Subgroup analyses of patients with or without hepatitis or cirrhosis were performed. RESULTS: Median patient OS was 13.9 months; 165 patients (37.7%) had no cirrhosis and 256 patients (58.4%) had no hepatitis. Overall, all staging systems were significantly less predictive of OS in patients who did not have cirrhosis or hepatitis. CONCLUSION: Our results advocate the need to further stratify HCC based on cirrhosis and hepatitis status, which may change patient risk-stratification and, ultimately, treatment decisions.",

We evaluated all operable patients treated for clinically resectable pancreatic head adenocarcinoma at our institution from 2002 to 2007. Rates of MMT completion, 90-day PMC, and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Ninety-five of 115 (83 %) NT and 29/50 (58 %) SF patients completed MMT. Patients who completed MMT lived longer than those who did not (36 vs. 11 months, p < 0.001). The most common reason that NT (11 %) and SF (26 %) patients failed to complete MMT was early disease progression. The rates of PMC among NT and SF patients were similar. Among SF patients, 69 % with no PMC completed MMT versus 29 % after PMC (p = 0.040). PMC were associated with decreased OS in SF patients but not in NT patients. The impact of early cancer progression and PMC upon completion of MMT is reduced by delivery of nonoperative therapies prior to pancreaticoduodenectomy.

This study was designed to analyze the incidence and risk factors for post-pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) morbidity/mortality in a multi-institutional cohort of BR-C patients. METHODS: Elective PDs were evaluated from the 2005-10 ACS-NSQIP database. BR-C was defined as age ≥ 80, poor PS, weight loss > 10 %, pulmonary disease, recent myocardial infarction/angina, stroke history, and/or preoperative sepsis. Variables associated with 30-day postoperative major complications (PMC) and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 3,033/8,266 (36.7 %) patients were BR-C. BR-C patients were more likely to suffer PMC (31.3 vs. 26.2 %) and mortality (4.1 vs. 2.3 %). BR-C patients with PMC suffered 50 % higher mortality versus non-BR-C patients with PMC (11.5 vs. 7.7 %) (all p < 0.001). For BR-C patients, multivariate analysis identified the following risk factors for PMC or mortality: albumin < 3.5 g/dL, dyspnea, preoperative sepsis, age ≥ 80, poor PS, anesthesia score ≥ 4, and intraoperative transfusion ≥ 4 units. CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide, one third of patients undergoing PD are medically borderline. These BR-C patients are at higher risk for and less able to be rescued from PMC. Surgeons should identify and optimize comorbidities and utilize prehabilitation to address functional deficits before elective PD.",

However, CTP stratification accuracy has been questioned. We hypothesized that plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a valid surrogate for hepatic reserve to replace the subjective parameters in CTP score to improve its prognostic accuracy. We retrospectively tested plasma IGF-1 levels in the training set (n = 310) from MD Anderson Cancer Center. Recursive partitioning identified three optimal IGF-1 ranges that correlated with overall survival (OS): greater than 50 ng/mL = 1 point; 26 to 50 ng/mL = 2 points; and less than 26 ng/mL = 3 points. We modified the CTP score by replacing ascites and encephalopathy grading with plasma IGF-1 value (IGF-CTP) and subjected both scores to log-rank analysis. Harrell's C-index and U-statistics were used to compare the prognostic performance of both scores in both the training and validation cohorts (n = 155). All statistical tests were two-sided. Patients' stratification was statistically significantly stronger for IGF-CTP than CTP score for the training (P = .003) and the validation cohort (P = .005). Patients reclassified by IGF-CTP relative to their original CTP score were better stratified by their new risk groups. Most important, patients classified as A by CTP but B by IGF-CTP had statistically significantly worse OS than those who remained under class A by IGF-CTP in both cohorts (P = .03 and P  <  .001, respectively, from Cox regression models). AB patients had a worse OS than AA patients in both the training and validation set (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]  = 1.03 to 2.04, P = .03; HR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.65 to 4.85, P  <  .001, respectively). The IGF-CTP score is simple, blood-based, and cost-effective, stratified HCC better than CTP score, and validated well on two independent cohorts.

Patients with DAC or AA had lower frequencies of lymph node metastasis and positive margin and better survival than those with PDA (P < .05). However, no differences in nodal metastasis, margin status, or survival were observed between DAC patients and those with AA. Our study showed that lymph node metastasis and AJCC stage are important prognostic factors for overall survival in DAC patients.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the archival H&E slides from 218 patients with PDAC who completed NCRT and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Sixty-five patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for PDAC without NCRT were used as controls. Various histological features were reviewed and correlated with NCRT and survival. The NCRT group had lower densities of PanIN2 (P = 0.004) and PanIN3 (P = 0.02) than the control group. The extent of fibrosis, the frequency of neuroma-like nerve proliferation and the frequency of islet cell aggregation were significantly higher in the NCRT group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The intensity of inflammation was less in the NCRT group than in the control group (P = 0.02). In the NCRT group, patents with moderate to severe fibrosis or grade 2 inflammation had poorer survival than those with mild fibrosis (P = 0.04) or those with grade 0 or grade 1 inflammation (P = 0.003), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue from patients who received NCRT had a reduced density of high-grade PanIN lesions, more pancreatic fibrosis, and higher frequencies of neuroma-like nerve proliferation and islet cell aggregation, but less inflammation, compared to tissue from those who did not receive NCRT.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In treating pancreatic cancer, there is no clearly defined optimal sequence of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. Therefore, cost-effectiveness should be considered. The objective of this study was to compare cost and outcomes between a surgery-first approach versus neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery for resectable pancreatic head cancer. METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed to compare the 2 approaches. Data from the National Cancer Database, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, and literature populated the surgery-first arm. Data from our prospectively maintained institutional pancreatic cancer database populated the neoadjuvant arm. Costs were estimated by Medicare payment (2011 U.S. dollars). Survival was reported in quality-adjusted life-months (QALMs). RESULTS: The neoadjuvant chemoradiation arm consisted of 164 patients who completed preoperative therapy. Of these, 36 (22 %) did not proceed to surgery; 12 (7 %) underwent laparotomy but had unresectable disease; and 116 (71 %) underwent definitive resection. The surgery-first approach cost $46,830 and yielded survival of 8.7 QALMs; the neoadjuvant chemoradiation approach cost $36,583 and yielded survival of 18.8 QALMs. In the neoadjuvant arm, costs and survival times for patients not undergoing surgery, those with unresectable disease at laparotomy, and those completing surgery were $12,401 and 7.7 QALMs, $20,380 and 7.1 QALMs, and $45,673 and 23.4 QALMs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation for pancreatic cancer identifies patients with early metastases or poor performance status, who can be spared an ineffective or prohibitively morbid operation, and is associated with improved survival at significantly lower cost than a surgery-first approach. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery is a strategy that provides more cost-effective care than a surgery-first approach.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endocrine FGF21 and FGF19 target adipocytes and hepatocytes through betaKlotho (KLB) and FGFR tyrosine kinases effecting glucose, lipid and energy metabolism. Both factors alleviate obesity and metabolic abnormalities which are contributing factors to breast tumor progression. Genomic manipulation of hepatic FGFR4 has uncovered roles of endocrine FGF signaling in both metabolic and cellular homeostasis. Here we determined whether systemic and microenvironmental metabolic alterations caused by the FGFR4 deficiency affect tumorigenesis in breast where FGFR4 is negligible. Breast tumors were induced in the bigenic mice with ablation of FGFR4 and overexpression of TGFα that activates Her2 in the ductal and lobular epithelium surrounded by adipocytes. Mammary tumorigenesis and alterations in systemic and breast microenvironmental metabolic parameters and regulatory pathways were analyzed. RESULTS: Ablation of FGFR4 had no effect on cellular homeostasis and Her2 activity of normal breast tissue. However, the absence of FGFR4 reduced TGFα-driven breast tumor incidence and progression and improved host survival. Notable increases in hepatic and serum FGF21, ileal FGF15/19, adiponectin and adipsin, and decreases in systemic Fetuin A, IGF-1, IGFBP-1, RBP4 and TIMP1 were observed. The ablation affected adipogenesis and secretory function of adipocytes as well as lipogenesis, glycolysis and energy homeostasis associated with the functions of mitochondria, ER and peroxisomes in the breast and tumor foci. Treatment with a chemical inhibitor of NAMPT involved in the pathways inhibited the growth and survival of breast tumor cells and tumor-initiating cell-containing spheres. The FGFR4 ablation also caused elevation of inflammatory factors in the breast. CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary role of FGFR4 in metabolism occurs in hepatocytes, its ablation results in a net inhibitory effect on mammary tumor progression. We suggest that the tumor-delaying effect of FGFR4 deficiency may be in large part due to elevated anti-obesogenic FGF21 that triggers tumor-suppressing signals from both peripheral and breast adipocytes. The predominant changes in metabolic pathways suggested roles of metabolic effects from both peripheral and breast adipocytes on metabolic reprogramming in breast epithelial cells that contribute to the suppression of tumor progression. These results provide new insights into the contribution of systemic and microenvironmental metabolic effects controlled by endocrine FGF signaling to breast carcinogenesis.",

                  "abstract": "CONTEXT: Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor genes in sporadic cancers. Somatic mutations of PTEN occur in many tumors including those of the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary tracts. Loss of PTEN expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma, gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of PTEN and its significance in ampullary adenocarcinoma (AA). DESIGN: We constructed tissue microarrays by using archival tissue from 92 patients (55 males, 37 females; median age, 63 years; age range, 37 to 87 years) with previously untreated AA who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at our institution. PTEN expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, scored semiquantitatively (based on staining intensity and percentage positive tumor cells), and correlated with clinicopathologic features and survival. RESULTS: Of 92 cases, 23 (25.0%) were PTEN negative. Loss of PTEN expression correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = .004), advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (P = .02), and higher frequency of recurrence (P = .03). Patients with PTEN-negative tumors had shorter disease-free survival (DFS, mean: 89.0 ± 20.8 months) and overall survival (OS, mean: 93.1 ± 19.1 months) than those with PTEN-positive tumors (DFS, mean: 161.4 ± 11.7 months, P = .01; OS, mean: 175.4 ± 11.0 months, P = .001). In multivariate analyses, PTEN expression was a prognostic factor for both DFS and OS, independent of AJCC stage, lymph node status, pathologic tumor (pT) stage, and differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of PTEN expression is associated with poor DFS and OS in patients with AA after curative surgery. PTEN expression may be used as a prognostic marker for patients with resected AA.",

Genome-wide association studies had reported that a variation in the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene is associated with high susceptibility to NAFLD. However, the relationship between this variation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been well established. We investigated the impact of PNPLA3 genetic variation (rs738409: C>G) on HCC risk and prognosis in the United States by conducting a case-control study that included 257 newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed Caucasian patients with HCC (cases) and 494 healthy controls. Multivariate logistics and Cox regression models were used to control for the confounding effects of HCC risk and prognostic factors. We observed higher risk of HCC for subjects with a homozygous GG genotype than for those with CC or CG genotypes, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 3.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-6.41). We observed risk modification among individuals with diabetes mellitus (OR = 19.11; 95% CI, 5.13-71.20). The PNPLA3 GG genotype was significantly associated with underlying cirrhosis in HCC patients (OR = 2.48; 95% CI, 1.05-5.87). Moreover, GG allele represents an independent risk factor for death. The adjusted hazard ratio of the GG genotype was 2.11 (95% CI, 1.26-3.52) compared with CC and CG genotypes. PNPLA3 genetic variation (rs738409: C>G) may determine individual susceptibility to HCC development and poor prognosis. Further experimental investigations are necessary for thorough assessment of the hepatocarcinogenic role of PNPLA3.",

There is evidence that combining gemcitabine with either erlotinib or cisplatin may be superior to single agent gemcitabine in patients with good performance (PS 0-1). We retrospectively compared outcomes of patients treated with either the three drug regimen of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and erlotinib (GCE) or the doublet of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) in order to assess the potential benefit of erlotinib. We also evaluated the role of erlotinib among smokers and non-smokers. We retrospectively analyzed 145 patients who presented between 2006 and 2009 with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer initially treated at the M.D. Anderson cancer center with either GC or GCE. Information on tumor characteristics and overall survival time (OS) was collected by medical record review. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate OS. Log rank tests were used to compare OS between groups. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the ability of patient prognostic variables or treatment group to predict OS. A total of 71 patients were treated with GC, while 74 were treated with GCE. Cox analyses found no significant difference in overall survival (median 5.5 vs. 8.0 months, respectively, p-value=0.1). Small sampling numbers may have contributed to this result. One year survival was 23 % in the GCE group and 13 % in the GC group. Patients with poor performance status (PS=2-3) had worse survival as compared to patients with better performance status (PS=0-1, p=0.001). As in earlier studies, patients treated with more lines of therapy tended to have better survival (p <0.0001), and CA19-9 was found to be a significant predictor for OS (p=0.001). No statistical evidence of a survival difference was found between smokers and non-smokers in both treatment groups (p=0.72). In conclusion, though there was a trend towards improved survival with the addition of erlotinib to gemcitabine and cisplatin, this does not reach statistical significance.",

METHODS: The study included 2 groups of patients treated with conventional high-dose PIAF (n = 84) between 1994 and 2003 and those without hepatitis or cirrhosis treated with modified PIAF (n = 33) between 2003 and 2012. Tolerance of chemotherapy, best radiographic response, rate of conversion to curative surgery, and overall survival were analyzed and compared between the 2 groups, and multivariate and logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of response and survival. RESULTS: The modified PIAF group had a higher median number of PIAF cycles (4 versus 2, P = .049), higher objective response rate (36% versus 15%, P = .013), higher rate of conversion to curative surgery (33% versus 10%, P = .004), and longer median overall survival (21.3 versus 10.6 months, P = .002).

We sought to identify a rational, cost-effective postoperative surveillance strategy. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of 5 postoperative surveillance strategies. No scheduled surveillance served as the baseline strategy. Clinical evaluation and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 testing without/with routine computed tomography and chest X-ray at either 6- or 3-month intervals served as the 4 comparison strategies of increasing intensity. We populated the model with symptom, recurrence, treatment, and survival data from patients who had received intensive surveillance after multimodality treatment at our institution between 1998 and 2008. Costs were based on Medicare payments (2011 US dollars). RESULTS: The baseline strategy of no scheduled surveillance was associated with a postoperative overall survival (OS) of 24.6 months and a cost of $3837/patient. Clinical evaluation and CA 19-9 assay every 6 months until recurrence was associated with a 32.8-month OS and a cost of $7496/patient, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $5364/life-year (LY). Additional routine imaging every 6 months incrementally increased total cost by $3465 without increasing OS. ICERs associated with clinic visits every 3 months without/with routine imaging were $127,680 and $294,696/LY, respectively. Sensitivity analyses changed the strategies' absolute costs but not the relative ranks of their ICERs. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the frequency and intensity of postoperative surveillance of patients after curative therapy for pancreatic cancer beyond clinical evaluation and CA 19-9 testing every 6 months increases cost but confers no clinically significant survival benefit.",

However, significant gaps still exist in our understanding of how such genetic alterations act in concert to induce PDAC development. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of tumorigenic transformation in the immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cell line by sequentially introducing PDAC signature alterations into this cell line. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The phenotype for stable expression of mutant K-ras, Her2, p16/p14shRNA, and Smad4shRNA in HPDE cells was examined by assays for cell proliferation, migration, invasion, soft agar, and orthotopic tumorigenesis. The mechanisms of tumorigenic transformation were further explored by gene expression profiling and pathway analyses. RESULTS: The transformed cells exhibited enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion, displayed anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and grew orthotopic tumors with some histopathologic features of PDAC. We found that Smad4 played key roles in the tumorigenic transformation of HPDE cells. We further found that MDM2 and Bmi-1 were overexpressed in the tumorigenic HPDE cells and that Bmi-1 overexpression was regulated by Smad4. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software analysis of microarray data revealed that dysregulation of integrin-linked kinase signaling and the cell cycle were the most significant changes involved in tumorigenic transformation. Altogether, this cell culture model closely recapitulated human pancreatic carcinogenesis from gene lesions, activation of specific signaling pathways, and some histopathologic features. CONCLUSION: The combination of activated K-ras and Her2 with inactivated p16/p14 and Smad4 was sufficient and essential to transform HPDE cells, thus revealing the potential tumorigenic mechanism.",

The MNGTCs contained multiple enlarged, hyperchromatic, irregular nuclei with ample eosinophilic cytoplasm, typically present in the solid area of the tumour. The MNGTCs had an immunohistochemical profile typical of the conventional SPN and were positive for vimentin, β-catenin, CD10 and progesterone receptor, but negative for pan-cytokeratin, chromogranin, synaptophysin, trypsin, Ki-67 and CD68 in all four cases. Patients of SPN with prominent MNGTCs were older than those with conventional SPN (P = 0.01); tumours were discovered incidentally by imaging studies for an unrelated disease in all four cases, and with a female to male ratio of 1:1. The proliferation index (Ki-67) was <1% in all four cases. None of the three patients for whom information was available developed recurrence during follow-up of 2.7, 3.8 and 5.0 years. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of MNGTCs in SPN most probably represents degenerative change of the tumour cells and does not seem to affect the prognosis.",

However, neither the complex multistep process that leads to activation of Akt1 through phosphorylation at Thr³⁰⁸ and Ser⁴⁷³ nor the mechanism by which Akt1 stimulates adipogenesis is fully understood. We found that the BSD domain-containing signal transducer and Akt interactor (BSTA) promoted phosphorylation of Akt1 at Ser⁴⁷³ in various human and murine cells, and we uncovered a function for the BSD domain in BSTA-Akt1 complex formation. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) facilitated the phosphorylation of BSTA and its association with Akt1, and the BSTA-Akt1 interaction promoted the association of mTORC2 with Akt1 and phosphorylation of Akt1 at Ser⁴⁷³ in response to growth factor stimulation. Furthermore, analyses of bsta gene-trap murine embryonic stem cells revealed an essential function for BSTA and phosphorylation of Akt1 at Ser⁴⁷³ in promoting adipocyte differentiation, which required suppression of the expression of the gene encoding the transcription factor FoxC2. These findings indicate that BSTA is a molecular switch that promotes phosphorylation of Akt1 at Ser⁴⁷³ and reveal an mTORC2-BSTA-Akt1-FoxC2-mediated signaling mechanism that is critical for adipocyte differentiation.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) is a rare variant of HCC. We report an analysis of the clinicopathologic features, treatment outcomes, and prognostic indicators of 94 cases. METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinicopathologic and treatment outcome data from 94 FLHCC patients (48 males and 46 females). Median overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves, and survival rates were compared by the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for univariate and multivariate estimation of hazard risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for factors that correlated with survival and disease recurrence after resection. RESULTS: Median age was 23 years (14-75); median OS was 57.2 months (95% CI, 36.4-77.9), and median RFS was 13.9 months (95% CI, 8.8-18.9). White race, female gender, early tumor stage, and tumor resection including metastasectomy were positively associated with longer OS, while female gender was the only significant positive predictor of longer RFS. Finally, the 5-fluorouracil-interferon combination was the most frequently used systemic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicate that surgical approaches including metastasectomy as the first-line treatment in FLHCC correlated with better outcome. Multimodality approaches, including neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies, prolonged patient survival.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) can be attributed to a variety of potential embolic sources, with differential response to anticoagulation. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective observational cohort study (27 sites) of consecutive adult patients with acute ischemic stroke due to ESUS (admitted 2015-2024) was conducted. The aim was to compare outcomes after antiplatelet(s) vs anticoagulant (±antiplatelet) treatment in patients with ESUS across potential embolic sources. The time from admission to the primary composite outcome of recurrent stroke, major bleeding, or death was assessed using adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression (clustered by site) and propensity score (PS) matching with (1) inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and (2) 10:1 nearest-neighbor matching with replacement, adjusting for age, stroke severity, and potential embolic sources (e.g., left ventricular injury and patent foramen ovale). Recurrent stroke, major bleeding, and death were also assessed as secondary outcomes, with stratification by potential embolic sources. RESULTS: Of the 2,328 included patients (n = 230 treated with anticoagulation), the median age was 65 years (interquartile range [IQR] 54-75), 50% were female, and the median NIH Stroke Scale score was 4 (IQR 2-11). Compared with patients treated using antiplatelet(s) therapies, those treated with anticoagulants were not at a lower risk of the primary outcome in the adjusted Cox model (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.69-1.45), adjusted IPTW regression model (aHR 1.15, 95% CI 0.79-1.66), or 10:1 PS-matched regression model (aHR 1.00, 95% CI 0.70-1.44). In patients with left ventricular injury, anticoagulation was associated with a lower rate of the primary outcome (aHR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.77; p-interaction <0.01) and trended toward a lower rate of recurrent ischemic stroke (aHR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05-1.08; p-interaction = 0.04) when compared with patients treated with antiplatelet(s). DISCUSSION: These real-world data validate randomized trial results in ESUS, which reported no net benefit of anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy. These data suggest possible benefit of anticoagulation in patients with left ventricular injury, as in previous cohort studies, although the findings are limited by the small number of patients treated with anticoagulation. Future trials should evaluate treatment differences in this subgroup. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Cardiac Abnormalities in Stroke Prevention and Risk of Recurrence; registration ID: NCT06398366. Registered on May 3, 2024. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that in patients with ESUS, anticoagulation was not superior to antiplatelet therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent stroke, bleeding, or death.",

In severe cases dysautonomia is representative of malignant catatonia. The treatment with benzodiazepines (BZDs) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may decrease morbidity and mortality in patients presenting with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and catatonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of eight patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis treated with ECT. We use clinical prediction scores (Clinical Assessment Scale for Autoimmune Encephalitis [CASE] and anti-NMDAR Encephalitis One-Year Functional Status scores) to compare expected outcomes and observed outcomes. RESULTS: CASE scores in our group ranged between 5 and 19, with a mean score of 13.8 (median 15.5). NEOS scores ranged from 2 to 4, with a mean and median of 3. Of the eight patients, six had a favourable modified Rankin Score (0-2) at a follow-up of 8 to 12 months. Patients received an average of 29.9 ECT treatments in total. CONCLUSIONS: Based on clinical prediction scores, this cohort had better than expected functional outcomes. We discuss the use of BZDs and ECT in these cases and propose a treatment algorithm for patients who present with catatonic syndrome in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",

We provide a descriptive analysis of the type of therapeutic AC used, the timing of introduction, rate of of radiographic vs symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (HT), and patient outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to the Neurosciences intensive care unit at a tertiary care center from January 2012 to December 2018. Inclusion criteria included admission imaging with stroke size ≥ two-thirds of the middle cerebral artery territory, ± other vascular territory, and need for therapeutic AC. HT categories included hemorrhagic infarction types 1 and 2 and parenchymal hematoma types 1 and 2. The primary outcome included HT with and without an associated clinical change. Secondary outcomes included disposition at discharge and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge and at follow-up when available. RESULTS: A total of 2,317 patients were screened, 380 met the inclusion criteria for LHI, and 105 received AC. The mean age was 64 years (SD 16.8), and 50% (n = 53) were female. The mean admission NIH Stroke Scale score was 20 (SD 5.9). The mean poststroke timing to initiation of AC was 17 days (SD 10.1) (median 14 [interquartile range 10-19 days]). Indications for AC included atrial fibrillation (51%), cardiac thrombus (19%), venous thromboembolism (19%), and other (10%). Heparin was most commonly used in the very early (≤7 days) group (n = 11, 79%), whereas vitamin K antagonists without a bridge were the most commonly used among the entire cohort (n = 54, 51%). Radiographic HT was seen in 68 patients (65%) before AC initiation. After initiation of AC, 70 patients had repeat imaging, with 6 cases (6%) of worsening radiographic HT and 4 cases (4%) of symptomatic deterioration, of which 3 required reversal of AC. At discharge, 7 patients (7%) had a good outcome (mRS score 0-2). DISCUSSION: Although radiographic HT is common among patients with LHI, it does not always portend symptomatic clinical deterioration. Further research regarding AC timing and safety is necessary.",

Leukocytosis has been observed to directly correlate with stroke severity but has not been specifically described in the LHI population. We hypothesized that patients with LHI and leukocytosis on admission have worse clinical outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients admitted to the neurosciences intensive care unit at a tertiary care center with the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke from Jan 2012 to Dec 2018. Inclusion criteria included admission imaging with stroke size greater than two-thirds of the middle cerebral artery territory, with or without other vascular territory involvement. Patients were excluded if antibiotics were started on admission for presumed infection. White blood cell count was recorded at admission, along with Modified Rankin Scale on admission and discharge, need for mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and discharge disposition. Logistic regression was used for association measures. RESULTS: Of the 2,318 patients that were screened, 360 met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 64, median was 63; 51.7% were female. Mean and median NIHSS were 21. Leukocytosis on admission was seen in 139 patients (38.6%), and it was associated with need for mechanical ventilation (p<0.0001, OR 2.54, [1.64-3.95]) and mortality during hospitalization (p<0.0003, OR 2.66, [1.56-4.55]). Results persisted after correction for age and sex in a logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: Leukocytosis on admission in patients with LHI significantly correlated with mortality and need for mechanical ventilation. There was a trend towards association with poor outcome at discharge, although not statistically significant. Further research may identify how leukocytosis and other SIRS markers may be used to prognosticate outcomes in this challenging patient population.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the differences between SP-PL and SP-LD achievement of optimal postoperative outcomes and postoperative complication rates. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively collected MIS database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive series of 152 patients with baseline (BL) and 1-year (1Y) postoperative radiographic/HRQL data were included. Patients placed in the SP-PL or SP-LD were isolated. Optimal outcome (OO) was defined as patients who experienced no complication requiring reoperation and achieved substantial clinical benefit (SCB) for NRS-leg or NRS-back. Means comparison analysis assessed differences in radiographic and clinical outcomes. ANCOVA and multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression were used to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: Totally, 59 SP-PL and 93 SP-LD patients were included. At baseline, cohorts were comparable in terms of age, gender, BMI, and CCI. Perioperatively, SP-PL patients had a significantly lower operative time (207.22 vs . 317.5 min; P <0.001), LOS (3.1 vs . 3.6 d; P =0.033), EBL (244.5 vs . 376.3 mL; P =0.023), and demonstrated lower perioperative complication rate (25.4% vs . 41.9%; P =0.038). Multivariable analysis indicated that SP-PL patients had a lower likelihood of cardiac perioperative complications (OR: 0.012, 95% CI: 0.0-0.6; P =0.026). Immediate postoperatively, SP-PL has a greater degree of segmental lordosis improvement from L1-L2 to L5-S1 (all; P <0.05). SP-PL patients have a higher likelihood of achieving SCB NRS-back at 1Y (OR: 8.0, 95% CI: 1.5-42.0; P =0.014) and MCID NRS-leg at 1Y (OR: 4.6, 95% CI: 1.002-21.2; P =0.49). The SP-PL cohort had a significantly greater percentage of OO (96.6% vs . 78.5%; P =0.002) and a higher likelihood of achieving OO in adjusted analysis (OR: 10.6, 95% CI: 2.1-53.3; P =0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Patients placed in the SP-PL during minimally invasive spine surgery exhibit a reduced rate of perioperative complications, higher incidence of SCB, and a superior rate of achieving optimal outcome at the one-year follow-up. These findings underscore the SP-PL position as a potentially advantageous approach for minimally invasive lumbar fusion.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The evolution of the transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) has resulted in the popularization of three main techniques: the minimally invasive TLIF (MIS-TLIF), the transfacet TLIF (TF-TLIF), and the percutaneous TLIF (Perc-TLIF). While MIS methods have previously been established as superior to open TLIF, there remains an unclear consensus on the utility and clinical outcomes associated with these different MIS techniques. This study aims to compare clinical and radiographic outcomes between the three approaches to TLIF. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the electronic medical records of a single fellowship-trained surgeon was performed for all patients receiving a single-level Perc-TLIF, MIS-TLIF, or TF-TLIF between 2018 and 2024. Variables collected included pre-operative and post-operative radiographic measures (e.g., change in spondylolisthesis, disc height, segmental lordosis), as well as clinical outcomes (e.g., length of stay, operating time, opioid utilization, readmission rates), and data were analyzed using a multivariable regression model. RESULTS: Ninety-four total patients undergoing TLIF surgery were identified (TF-TLIF: n=17; MIS-TLIF: n=31; Perc-TLIF: n=46). In our regression model accounting for other clinical and radiographic variables, the transfacet approach was associated with greater change in spondylolisthesis (vs. MIS, P=0.03) and posterior disc height (vs. MIS, P=0.005). The percutaneous approach was associated with lower estimated blood loss (vs. MIS, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Although there are limitations, the TF-TLIF shows promising results compared to MIS-TLIF and Perc-TLIF approaches, with improved spondylolisthesis reduction and posterior disc height correction.",

Existing studies comparing the utility of these approaches for adult spinal deformity (ASD) correction have been limited to small, single-center series. No study has investigated revision single-position PTP-LLIF versus standard LLIF in a large cohort of ASD patients. METHODS: A multi-center cohort of all patients undergoing PTP-LLIF or standard LLIF revision for ASD between 2013 and 2021 were identified from 12 spine surgery centers. Standing 36″ scoliosis radiographs were retrospectively reviewed for assessment of spinopelvic parameters including pelvic incidence (PI), lumbar lordosis (LL), and PI-LL mismatch preoperatively and immediately postoperative. Multivariable analysis was performed to assess the primary outcome measure: postoperative change in regional sagittal alignment (PI-LL mismatch) between patients who had undergone revision surgery via PTP versus standard LLIF. Postoperative PI-LL mismatch correction was defined by PI-LL mismatch <10°. RESULTS: Two-hundred and two patients were retrospectively identified and included for formal analysis. One-hundred and fifty-one (n = 151, 74.8 %) patients underwent PTP revision while 51 (25.2 %) underwent standard LLIF revision. Patients undergoing PTP had greater pre-operative PI-LL mismatch (21.4 vs. 10.45°; p < 0.001). Complication rate (p = 0.029), length of stay (<0.001) and total follow up (p = 0.005) were decreased in the PTP patients when compared to standard LLIF, while fluoroscopy time (p = 0.036) and fluoroscopy dosage (p = 0.011) was increased. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that PTP was associated with increased change of having a postoperative PI-LL value <10° (p < 0.001), in addition to being associated with increased correction of PI-LL mismatch (p = 0.002) when controlling for multiple other variables. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, PTP-LLIF was associated with greater net improvement in postoperative PI-LL mismatch, the primary outcome measure of this study. The present retrospective analysis expands upon previous studies demonstrating the potential superiority of PTP-LLIF versus conventional LLIF for sagittal plane correction in ASD revision surgery.",

                  "abstract": "Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) is a commonly employed surgical technique for managing lumbar degenerative disease and spinal instability. While it offers advantages over posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), traditional TLIF often involves prolonged recovery and morbidity due to muscle retraction. To improve outcomes, several alternative techniques have emerged, including minimally invasive TLIF (MIS-TLIF), trans-Kambin percutaneous TLIF (PE-TLIF), and transfacet TLIF (TF-TLIF). Each approach presents distinct anatomical and technical advantages, yet no standardized framework exists to guide their selection based on individual patient anatomy. In this study, we review the evolution of TLIF techniques and propose a novel algorithm that integrates patient-specific imaging, anatomical variability, and segmentation data to guide surgical decision-making. By analyzing the surgical corridors, indications, and limitations of each approach, and presenting representative clinical cases, we demonstrate how this algorithm can be applied in practice. For instance, TF-TLIF may be optimal in patients requiring direct decompression without major deformity, while PE-TLIF may be appropriate for those with Kambin's triangles measuring ≥ 9 mm, allowing for indirect decompression. This tailored framework aims to optimize outcomes and reduce complications. Further prospective validation and incorporation of AI-driven segmentation tools are needed to support broader clinical implementation.",

Treatment with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has demonstrated possible utility in previous observational studies. In this article, we discuss the protocol for an actively enrolling, NIH-funded clinical trial investigating the use of dual lead (thoracic and conus medullaris) SCS as a possible treatment of SCI. METHODS: The clinical trial is a single-blinded, 2-arm parallel study for patients with a history of chronic neuropathic pain after thoracic SCI. Patients are allocated 1:1 to SCS \"on\" or SCS \"off\" to which they are formally blinded for 3 months. At 3 months, a 1-way crossover will occur. The primary outcome is the change in the Pain Impact Score of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory-SCI from baseline to 3 months. Secondary outcomes include the changes in electromyography amplitudes, motor and sensory American Spinal Injury Association scores, functional status using the spinal cord independence measure, Visual Analog Scale for pain, active medication use, Patient Global Impression of Change scale, quality of life, bladder control diaries, and harness-supported walking. As the trial is ongoing, data are not yet available for public access. Details regarding data access will be provided in the subsequent publication. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect to see differential improvements in the Pain Impact Score of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory-SCI, motor and sensory American Spinal Injury Association score, Visual Analog Scale, spinal cord independence measure, and Patient Global Impression of Change in the initial \"on\" vs \"off\" groups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. DISCUSSION: Dual lead SCS may serve as a safe and viable treatment option for patients living with SCI. We anticipate patients who undergo SCS to have improved neuropathic pain and neurological function, with greater improvement in patients receiving longer SCS.",

While general anesthesia (GA) remains standard, spinal anesthesia (SA) may offer faster recovery and fewer side effects. This study compares the clinical and economic outcomes of GA versus SA in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). Methods: A retrospective review of 18 TLIF patients (2018-2022) was performed, with 9 patients in each cohort. Patients were matched by demographics and procedure type. Data collected included operative time, blood loss, complications, postoperative opioid utilization, and 30-day readmissions. Costs were analyzed in categories: anesthesia, implants, inpatient care, operating room (OR) supplies, OR time, and PACU fees, using Wilcoxon Rank T-tests and Pearson Chi-Squared tests. Results: Clinical outcomes such as blood loss, and operative time were similar between groups. However, SA patients had significantly shorter LOS compared to GA (SA: 12 h vs. GA: 84 h, % difference: -150%, p = 0.04). Additionally, SA patients had lower total direct costs ($27,881.85 vs. $35,669.01; p = 0.027). Significant cost reductions with SA were noted in OR supplies/medications ($7367.93 vs. $10,879.46; p = 0.039) and inpatient costs ($621.65 vs. $3092.66; p = 0.027). Within these categories, reductions were observed for intravenous solutions, sedatives/anesthetics, pressure management, labs, imaging, evaluations, hospital care, and medications. Although costs for implants, anesthesia care, OR time, and PACU fees were lower with SA, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: In TLIF for DLSD, SA provides significant economic advantages over GA while yielding comparable clinical outcomes. These results support SA as a cost-effective alternative, warranting further prospective studies to confirm these findings.",

                  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (ALIF) is a commonly performed spine surgery procedure used to treat lumbar conditions such as degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and spinal deformities. Traditionally, it has been performed using open and mini-open surgical techniques. Recently, however, laparoscopic and robotic-assisted ALIF have gained attention for their potential benefits, including shorter recovery times, fewer complications, and improved patient outcomes. However, the safety, effectiveness, and long-term outcomes of these newer techniques remain to be fully compared to conventional methods. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched for studies on laparoscopic and robotic approaches to the anterior spine, with a focus on ALIF. Article selection and data extraction were independently conducted by two reviewers. Studies involving animal models, non-ALIF robotic techniques, or non-English publications were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 650 articles were initially identified. After screening, a full-text review was conducted on 80 articles, of which 48 studies met the inclusion criteria: 42 focused on laparoscopic ALIF (L-ALIF) and 6 on robotic-assisted ALIF (R-ALIF). Laparoscopic ALIF achieved similar outcomes to mini-open methods, offering limited consistent benefits while presenting challenges such as a steep learning curve and a higher risk of retrograde ejaculation. Data on robotic-assisted ALIF, though limited, indicated improved precision and a reduced rate of intraoperative complications. However, high costs, logistical challenges, and the lack of substantial long-term outcome data remain significant barriers to the broader adoption of this technique in spine surgery. CONCLUSION: L-ALIF and R-ALIF present promising minimally invasive alternatives to mini-open ALIF approaches. L-ALIF yields outcomes similar to mini-open techniques, though its technical demands warrant careful consideration. R-ALIF shows potential for improved precision and reduced complications, but logistical and financial constraints limit its wider adoption. Future studies should focus on multicenter prospective trials, alongside efforts to reduce costs and enhance training, to refine the role of these techniques in optimizing patient outcomes.",

OBJECTIVE: To review the application of machine learning (ML) in scoliosis management, while addressing the limitations and challenges in implementing ML in scoliosis practice. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ML has revolutionized medical research, particularly in scoliosis management, enabling automated assessment of diagnosis, disease progression, and treatment response. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database. The literature search included the PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases. Studies since 2019 were included if they used ML models in scoliosis management. Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Data extraction focused on the scoliosis type, sample size, model utility, ML model architecture, model development, training data, cross-validation, single- or multi-center study design, and study/model limitations. RESULTS: The study included 63 articles that underwent full-text review. The most commonly studied disorders were adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (n=48) and adult spinal deformity (n=15), with five studies including other disorders and one not specifying. The uses of ML were diagnosis/classification (n=38), operative outcomes (n=11), prognosis (n=7), and risk assessment (n=7). The most used models included convolutional neural networks (n=38), random forest (n=11), and support vector machines (n=9). Only 16 studies reported external validation, while none implemented their model in practice. Common limitations reported were small sample size, artifacts obscuring images, potential selection bias, limited variety in disease severity, exclusion of parameters, lack of patient diversity, varying accuracy with curve site and severity, retrospective study, and lack of external validation. CONCLUSION: The current state of machine learning in scoliosis management is promising, showing potential for improving diagnosis and optimizing treatments. However, significant challenges remain. To fully understand the benefits of ML, larger, multi-center studies with more validation and effective implementation strategies are needed.",

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a potentially useful tool to aid the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of LBP. PURPOSE: In this review, we assess the scope of ML applications in the LBP literature and outline gaps and opportunities. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A scoping review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. METHODS: Articles were extracted from the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases. Title/abstract and full-text screening was performed by two reviewers. Data on model type, model inputs, predicted outcomes, and ML methods were collected. RESULTS: In total, 223 unique studies published between 1988 and 2023 were identified, with just over 50% focused on low-back-pain detection. Neural networks were used in 106 of these articles. Common inputs included patient history, demographics, and lab values (67% total). Articles published after 2010 were also likely to incorporate imaging data into their models (41.7% of articles). Of the 212 supervised learning articles identified, 168 (79.4%) mentioned use of a training or testing dataset, 116 (54.7%) utilized cross-validation, and 46 (21.7%) implemented hyperparameter optimization. Of all articles, only 8 included external validation and 9 had publicly available code. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the rapid application of ML in LBP research, a majority of articles do not follow standard ML best practices. Furthermore, over 95% of articles cannot be reproduced or authenticated due to lack of code availability. Increased collaboration and code sharing are needed to support future growth and implementation of ML in the care of patients with LBP.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anterior column realignment (ACR) is a powerful minimally invasive surgery technique to restore sagittal alignment in adult spinal deformity (ASD). This can accomplish similar segmental lordosis restoration as 3-column osteotomy with less blood loss and comparable complication rates. ACR can be performed at adjacent disease segments in the proximal lumbar spine in revision cases. However, two thirds of physiologic lordosis occurs between L4-S1, and concerns remain about altered lumbar morphology. We evaluated patients who underwent proximal lumbar ACR for iatrogenic flatback deformity. METHODS: A total of 19 consecutive patients who underwent L1-2 or L2-3 ACR were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with lateral minimally invasive surgery interbody technique, followed by posterior reconstruction with Smith-Peterson osteotomy. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic and clinical outcomes were obtained. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 19 months. All but 1 patient had a history of prior lumbar or lumbo-sacral fusion. Sagittal vertical axis and pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis decreased from 11.9 cm to 6.1 cm (P < 0.0001) and 34.2° to 12.8° (P < 0.0001). Segmental lordosis increased from -2.7° to 21.9° (P < 0.0001). Proximal lumbar lordosis increased from -0.4° to 22.6° (P < 0.0001), and lordosis distribution index decreased from 79.5% to 48.9% (P < 0.0001). Mean Oswestry Disability Index and numeric pain rating scale back pain scores decreased from 58.0 to 36.2 (P = 0.0041) and 7.9 to 3.4 (P < 0.0001), respectively. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical and Mental Health T-scores increased from 34.1 to 43.3 (P = 0.0049) and 40.4 to 45.0 (P = 0.0993), respectively. Major complication rate was 15.8%. One patient required revision for mechanical failure. There were no permanent neurological or vascular injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Proximal lumbar ACR plus Smith-Peterson osteotomy can achieve sagittal correction with low major complication rates in patients with ASD and prior distal fusion. Differentially increasing proximal lumbar lordosis and lowering lumbar distribution index did not have deleterious effects on radiographic or clinical outcomes. Further work is needed to understand the effect of proximal ACR in the surgical management of ASD.",

                  "abstract": "Osteobiologics are increasingly used in orthopedics and spine surgery to facilitate bone healing and prevent nonunion. Synthetic osteobiologics are artificial materials crafted in laboratories that aim to replicate the natural composition and functionality of bone. Notable materials such as calcium phosphate and calcium sulfate are engineered to mirror the mineral aspect of bone. They mimic human bone functionality, exhibiting osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic properties. These characteristics promote cell attachment, migration, recruitment, and differentiation. Consequently, synthetic osteobiologics (osteoconductive grafts) have been introduced in bone fracture repair. The main strength of synthetic osteobiologics in spine surgery lies in improving fusion rates and clinical outcomes. The commercial biologics landscape boasts an excess of 350 bone substitute materials, a number that continues to grow exponentially with the development of subtypes. However, the proliferation of these products, primarily driven by the medical device industry and nonacademic entities, has been accompanied by a significant dearth of supporting empirical data. This deficiency underscores the imperative need for rigorous scrutiny and research to establish a solid foundation for their utilization. Healthcare professionals require high-quality research in large prospective studies with satisfactory follow-up periods to interpret and compare the performance of osteobiologics. It is particularly imperative to study the added cost of using these materials in spine surgery. In the current review, we provide an overview of the currently available synthetic osteobiologics used in spine surgery.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare perioperative outcomes between these approaches. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for all relevant observational comparative studies. RESULTS: 5 randomized trials and 22 comparative cohort studies were included. Compared to the traditional open approach (n=959), the Wiltse approach (n=410) was associated with significantly lower operative time, intraoperative estimated blood loss (EBL), and length of stay (LOS). There was no significant difference between the two in terms of postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) and Cobb angle. Compared to the percutaneous approach (n=980), the Wiltse approach was associated with shorter operative and fluoroscopy time, as well as significantly improved Cobb and vertebral body angles. The percutaneous approach was associated with improved vertebral body height. There was no significant difference between the two for blood loss, postoperative VAS, or LOS. Compared to the traditional open approach, the percutaneous approach was associated with shorter operative time, lower EBL, shorter LOS and better postoperative VAS and Oswestry Disability Index. There was no difference between the two in postoperative Cobb angle, vertebral angle, or vertebral body height. Overall study heterogeneity was high.

METHODS: Patients who underwent index ACDF with a commercially available ISa by a fellowship-trained spine surgeon between January 2018 and December 2021 were retrospectively included. Patients with less than 90-days follow-up or those who underwent ACDF for trauma, infection, or tumor were excluded. Demographic data, perioperative data, radiographic data and perioperative complications were collected. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included for study. Eight patients (17.8%) experienced dysphagia immediately following surgery, which resolved by 6 months post-op, barring 1 patient. Preoperative global and segmental lordosis were 10.4°±9.3° and 6.9°±7.3° respectively. At three months postoperatively, global and segmental lordosis were 8.9°±7.9° (P=0.50) and 7.0°±5.9° (P=0.56) respectively. Fusion rate at six months was 78.3% (18/23) and 100% (18/18) at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: ACDF with ISa is a viable alternative to traditional plate-cage systems. ISa shows lower rates of immediate, 3-month and 6-month dysphagia than traditional plate-cage systems described in the literature. More controlled studies on larger populations will help formulate a concrete conclusion on the advantages of ISa spacers.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Minimally-invasive trans-facet lumbar interbody fusion (LIF) is an emerging technique that offers the advantages of being safe, enabling decompression, and facilitating patient recovery. An innovative cage that expands in two dimensions has been introduced to restore segmental lordosis and disc height while minimizing the risk of cage subsidence. This study aimed to report our surgical technique of trans-facet LIF utilizing the innovative cag and to report the early clinical outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and radiographs of patients who underwent trans-facet LIF with dual-dimension expandable cages from two institutions: Duke University Hospital and Vail-Summit Orthopaedics and Neurosurgery. The analysis covered patient demographics, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analogue scale (VAS) for back pain, surgical data, complications, and radiographic parameters. Clinical outcomes were compared between pre- and one year post-operation, while radiographic outcomes were compared between pre- and three months post-operation. RESULTS: Twenty patients with a mean age of 61.2 years were included. Seventeen patients (85.0%) had spondylolisthesis, and L4/5 (68.2%) was the most common pathology level. Twelve patients (60.0%) underwent awake surgery, and the mean operative time was 164.5±36.1 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 64.0±39.5 mL and a hospital stay of 1.75±1.2 days. Four patients (20.0%) experienced cage subsidence; however, none required additional surgery. The VAS score significantly improved from a preoperative average of 7.3±2.7 to 2.6±1.6 one year post-operation (P=0.02). The ODI score also showed a significant decrease, from 48.7±22.9 preoperatively to 16.4±11.1 one year postoperatively (P=0.03). Notably, 80% and 83.3% of patients achieved the minimum clinically important difference in VAS and ODI scores, respectively. The degree of spondylolisthesis was significantly reduced from a median of 5.9 mm preoperatively to 0 mm postoperatively (P<0.001). Additionally, both anterior and posterior disc heights significantly increased after surgery, from 9.8±4.7 to 15.1±2.6 mm (anterior) and from 4.9±3.3 to 10.5±2.2 mm (posterior) (P<0.001 for both). The mean segmental lordosis increased by 2.9 degrees and was associated with cage height (P=0.03), while spinopelvic parameters remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally-invasive trans-facet LIF with dual-dimension expandable cages demonstrates a substantial capacity for spondylolisthesis reduction and disc height restoration, and provides good short-term clinical outcomes. It may be the most appropriate method for deploying this large cage as it allows for a large, unobstructed pathway to the disc. However, future studies are needed to determine the long-term outcomes, including the arthrodesis rate.",

OBJECTIVES: Predicting patient risk of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) alerts preoperatively can aid patient counselling and surgical planning. Sielatycki et al established an axial-MRI-based spinal cord classification system to predict risk of IONM alerts in scoliosis correction surgery. We aim to systematically review the literature on operative and radiologic factors associated with IONM alerts, including a novel spinal cord classification. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines. A literature search identifying all observational studies comparing patients with and without IONM alerts was conducted. Suitable studies were included. Patient demographics, radiological measures and operative factors were collected. RESULTS: 11 studies were included including 3040 patients. Relative to type 3 cords, type 1 (OR = .03, CI = .01-.08, P < .00001), type 2 (OR = .08, CI = .03, P <.00001) and all non-type 3 cords (OR = .05, CI = .02-.16, P < .00001) were associated with significantly lower odds of IONM alerts. Significant radiographic measures for IONM alerts included coronal Cobb angle (MD = 10.66, CI = 5.77-15.56, P < .00001), sagittal Cobb angle (MD = 9.27, CI = 3.28-14.73, P = .0009), sagittal deformity angle ratio (SDAR) (MD = 2.76, CI = 1.57-3.96, P < .00001) and total deformity angle ratio (TDAR) (MD = 3.44, CI = 2.27-4.462, P < .00001). Clinically, estimated blood loss (MD = 274.13, CI = -240.03-788.28, P = .30), operation duration (MD = 50.79, CI = 20.58-81.00, P = .0010), number of levels fused (MD = .92, CI = .43-1.41, P = .0002) and number of vertebral levels resected (MD = .43, CI = .01-.84, P = .05) were significantly greater in IONM alert patients.

This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted (RA) surgery specifically for scoliosis surgery by comparing RA to both navigation systems (NS) and conventional freehand techniques (CF). METHODS: As per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted via an electronic search of the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). All papers comparing RA to either NS or CF for posterior spinal fusion in scoliosis were included. Fixed and random effects models of analysis were utilised based on analysis heterogeneity. RESULTS: 10 observational studies were included in total. RA had significantly greater odds of accurate pedicle screw placement relative to both NS (OR = 2.02, CI = 1.52-2.67, p < 0.00001) and CF (OR = 3.06, CI = 1.79-5.23, p < 0.00001). The downside of RA was the significantly greater operation duration relative to NS (MD = 10.74, CI = 3.52-17.97, p = 0.004) and CF (MD = 40.27, CI = 20.90, p < 0.0001). Perioperative outcomes including estimated blood loss, radiation exposure, length of hospital stay, cobb angle correction rate, postoperative SRS score, VAS pain score, JOA score, as well as rates of neurological injury and revision surgery, were comparable between the groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: RA offers significantly greater pedicle screw placement accuracy relative to NS and CF, however, surgery can take longer. In terms of perioperative outcomes, all three techniques are comparable.",

                  "abstract": "Cervical spine injuries (CSIs) are heterogeneous in nature and often lead to long-term disability and morbidity. However, there are few recent and comprehensive epidemiological studies on CSI. The objective of this study was to characterize recent trends in CSI patient demographics, incidence, etiology, and injury level. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was used to extract data on CSIs from 2002 to 2022. Weighted national estimates of CSI incidence were computed using yearly population estimates interpolated from U.S. census data. Data analysis involved extracting additional information from patient narratives to categorize injury etiology (i.e., fall) and identify CSI level. K-means clustering was performed on cervical levels to define upper versus lower cervical injuries. Appropriate summary statistics including mean with 95% confidence intervals and frequency were reported for age, sex, race, ethnicity, etiology, and disposition. Age between groups was compared using an independent weighted Z-test. All categorical variables were compared using Pearson chi-squared tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Ordinary least squares linear regression was used to quantify the rate of change of various metrics with time. A total of 11,822 patient records met the study criteria. The mean age of patients was 62.4 ± 22.7 years, 52.4% of whom were male and 61.4% of whom were White, 7.4% were Black, 27.8% were not specified, and the remaining comprised a variety of ethnicities. The most common mechanism of CSI was a fall (67.3%). There was a significant increase in the incidence of cervical injuries between 2003 and 2022 (p < 0.001). Unbiased K-means clustering defined upper cervical injuries as C1-C3 and lower cervical injuries as C4-C7. The mean age of patients with upper CSIs was 72.3 ± 19.6, significantly greater than the age of those with lower CSIs (57.1 ± 23.1, p < 0.001). Compared with lower CSI, White patients were more likely to have an upper CSI (67.4% vs. 73.7%; p < 0.001). While Black/African American (7.5% vs. 3.8%) and Hispanic (2.5% vs. 1.0%) patients were more likely to have a lower CSI (p < 0.001). Our study identified a significant increase in the incidence of CSIs over time, which was associated with increasing patient age. Our study detected a pragmatic demarcation of classifying upper injuries as C1-C3 and lower cervical injuries as C4-C7. Upper injuries were seen more often in older, White females who were treated and admitted, and lower injuries were seen more often in young, Black male patients who were released without admission.",

We aimed to quantify any pathology-driven anatomic changes to the trans-facet corridor, which could thereby alter the ideal laterality of approach to the disc space. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we measured the areas and maximum permissible cannula diameters of the trans-facet corridor using commercially available software (BrainLab, Munich, Germany). Exiting and traversing nerve roots, thecal sacs, and lumbar vertebrae were manually segmented on T2-SPACE magnetic resonance imaging. Spondylolisthesis, disc protrusions, and disc space heights were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 118 trans-facet corridors were segmented bilaterally in 16 patients (65.6 ± 12.1 years, 43.8% female, body mass index 29.2 ± 5.1 kg/m2). The mean areas at L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 were 89.4 ± 24.9 mm2, 124 ± 39.4 mm2, 123 ± 26.6 mm2, and 159 ± 42.7 mm2, respectively. The mean permissible cannula diameter at the same levels were 7.85 ± 1.43 mm, 8.98 ± 1.72 mm, 8.93 ± 1.26 mm, and 10.2 ± 1.94 mm, respectively. Both parameters increased caudally. Higher degrees for spondylolisthesis were associated with larger areas and maximum cannula diameters on regression analysis (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate that pathology, like spondylolisthesis, can increase the area of the trans-facet corridor. By understanding this effect, surgeons can better decide on the optimal approach to the disc while taking into consideration a patient's unique anatomy.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There has been a rise in minimally invasive methods to access the intervertebral disk space posteriorly given their decreased tissue destruction, lower blood loss, and earlier return to work. Two such options include the percutaneous lumbar interbody fusion through the Kambin triangle and the endoscopic transfacet approach. However, without accurate preoperative visualization, these approaches carry risks of damaging surrounding structures, especially the nerve roots. Using novel segmentation technology, our goal was to analyze the anatomic borders and relative sizes of the safe triangle, trans-Kambin, and the transfacet corridors to assist surgeons in planning a safe approach and determining cannula diameters. METHODS: The areas of the safe triangle, Kambin, and transfacet corridors were measured using commercially available software (BrainLab, Munich, Germany). For each approach, the exiting nerve root, traversing nerve roots, theca, disk, and vertebrae were manually segmented on 3-dimensional T2-SPACE magnetic resonance imaging using a region-growing algorithm. The triangles' borders were delineated ensuring no overlap between the area and the nerves. RESULTS: A total of 11 patients (65.4 ± 12.5 years, 33.3% female) were retrospectively reviewed. The Kambin, safe, and transfacet corridors were measured bilaterally at the operative level. The mean area (124.1 ± 19.7 mm 2 vs 83.0 ± 11.7 mm 2 vs 49.5 ± 11.4 mm 2 ) and maximum permissible cannula diameter (9.9 ± 0.7 mm vs 6.8 ± 0.5 mm vs 6.05 ± 0.7 mm) for the transfacet triangles were significantly larger than Kambin and the traditional safe triangles, respectively ( P < .001). CONCLUSION: We identified, in 3-dimensional, the borders for the transfacet corridor: the traversing nerve root extending inferiorly until the caudal pedicle, the theca medially, and the exiting nerve root superiorly. These results illustrate the utility of preoperatively segmenting anatomic landmarks, specifically the nerve roots, to help guide decision-making when selecting the optimal operative approach.",

A single-institution retrospective study was conducted to investigate whether 1-level percLIF is associated with decreased narcotic consumption compared to 1-level MIS-TLIF in the first 24-hour following surgery. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients undergoing either single-level percLIF or MIS-TLIF from January 2018 to December 2021. Opioid consumption in the 24-hour following surgery was converted into total morphine milligram equivalents (MME). The primary outcome used univariate and multivariate regression analysis to compare MME consumption between the MIS-TLIF and percLIF groups. Secondary outcome variables included, estimated blood loss, total intraoperative MME, MME at discharge, MME at 30 days post-op, exiting nerve root injury, post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) visual analogue scale (VAS) score at handoff, time to first ambulation, distance ambulated post-operative day one and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients (21 percLIF vs. 30 MIS-TLIF) were included in the study. Univariate regression analysis revealed that on average patients who underwent percLIF had a 24-hour postoperative MME -50.8 mg (95% CI: -91.6, -10) lower than those who had MIS-TLIF (P=0.02). On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for sex and age, 24-hour postoperative MME closely failed to meet statistical significance (P=0.06) with an average of -40.8 mg (95% CI: -83.2, 1.6) MME in percLIF patients compared to MIS-TLIF. There was no statistically significant difference in MME between MIS-TLIF and percLIF at the time of discharge and at 30 days post-op. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of the current opioid epidemic in the United States and increased numbers of patients undergoing lumbar interbody fusion, spine surgeons must continue to do their part helping reduce the need for opioid prescriptions for postoperative pain management. New \"ultra-MIS\" techniques such as percLIF allow surgeons to further decrease tissue trauma, which should lead to reduced need for post-operative narcotic requirements.",

Given the potential for opioid-related morbidity and mortality, postoperative weaning is often a goal of surgery. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between preoperative opioid use and postoperative complete opioid weaning among lumbar decompression patients. METHODS: We surveyed the IBM Marketscan Databases for patients who underwent lumbar decompression during 2008-2017, had >30 days of opioid use in the year preceding surgery, and consumed a daily average of >0 morphine milligram equivalents in the 3 months preceding surgery. We used multivariable logistic regression and marginal standardization to examine the association between preoperative opioid use duration, average daily dose, and their interactions with complete opioid weaning in the 10-12 months after surgery. RESULTS: Of the 11,114 patients who met inclusion criteria, most (54.7%, n = 6083) had a preoperative average daily dose of 1-20 morphine milligram equivalents. Postoperatively, 6144 patients (55.3%) remained on opioids. For patients with >180 days of preoperative use, the adjusted probability of weaning increased as the preoperative dose decreased. Obesity increased the likelihood of weaning, whereas older age, several comorbidities, female sex, and Medicaid decreased the odds of weaning. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who used opioids for longer preoperatively were less likely to completely wean following surgery. Among patients with >180 days of preoperative use, those with lower preoperative doses were more likely to wean. Weaning was also associated with several clinical and demographic factors. These findings may help shape expectations regarding opioid use following lumbar decompression.",

Results: Results showed significant improvements: sagittal vertical axis decreased by 2.4 cm, lumbar lordosis increased by 9.1°, pelvic tilt improved by 3.3°, segmental lordosis across the fusion construct increased by 12.2°, and coronal Cobb angle improved by 6.3°. These benefits remained consistent over the follow-up period. Correlational analysis showed a positive association between improvements in PROs and SVA and SL. When compared to hybrid approaches, prone lateral yielded greater improvements in SVA. Conclusions: Prone lateral surgery demonstrated favorable outcomes with reasonable perioperative risks. However, further research comparing this technique with standard minimally invasive lateral approaches, hybrid, and open approaches is warranted for a comprehensive evaluation.",

                  "abstract": "The transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) has seen significant evolution since its early inception, reflecting advancements in surgical techniques, patient safety, and outcomes. Originally described as an improvement over the posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), the TLIF began as an open surgical procedure, that notably reduced the need for the extensive neural retractation that hindered the PLIF. In line with the broader practice of surgery, trending toward minimally invasive access, the TLIF was followed by the development of the minimally invasive TLIF (MIS-TLIF), a technique that further decreased tissue trauma and postoperative complications. Subsequent advancements, including Trans-Kambin's Triangle TLIF (percLIF) and transfacet LIF, have continued to refine surgical access, minimize surgical footprint, and reduce the risk of injury to the patient. The latest evolution, as we will describe it, the patient-specific TLIF, is a culmination of the aforementioned adaptations and incorporates advanced imaging and segmentation technologies into perioperative planning, allowing surgeons to tailor approaches based on individual patient anatomy and pathology. These developments signify a shift towards more precise methods in spine surgery. The ongoing evolution of the TLIF technique illustrates the dynamic nature of surgery and emphasizes the need for continued adaptation and refinement.",

The authors present the case of an awake percutaneous robot-assisted SIJ fusion leading to an SGA pseudoaneurysm. OBSERVATIONS: An 80-year-old male, who had undergone an awake percutaneous robot-assisted SIJ fusion, experienced postoperative left hip pain and bruising. Subsequent arteriography demonstrated an SGA branch pseudoaneurysm requiring coil embolization. LESSONS: An SGA injury, although uncommon (1.2% incidence), can arise from percutaneous screw placement, aberrant anatomy, or hardware contact. Thorough preoperative imaging, precise robot-assisted screw insertion, and soft tissue protection are crucial to mitigate risks. Immediate angiography aids in prompt diagnosis and effective intervention. Comprehensive knowledge of anatomical variants is essential for managing complications and optimizing preventative measures in robot-assisted SIJ fusion.",

This approach significantly reduces muscular damage and blood loss by minimizing soft tissue stripping, leading to less postoperative pain and a faster postoperative recovery. As scientific evidence accumulates, the efficacy and safety of cervical endoscopic spine surgery are continually affirmed. Both anterior and posterior endoscopic approaches have surfaced as viable alternative treatments for various cervical spine pathologies. Newer techniques, such as endoscopic-assisted fusion, the anterior transcorporeal approach, and unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression, have been developed to enhance clinical outcomes and broaden surgical indications. Despite its advantages, this approach faces challenges, including a steep learning curve, increased radiation exposure for both surgeons and patients, and a relative limitation in addressing multi-level pathologies. However, the future of cervical endoscopic spine surgery is promising, with potential enhancements in clinical outcomes and safety on the horizon. This progress is fueled by integrating advanced imaging and navigation technologies, applying regional anesthesia for improved and facilitated postoperative recovery, and incorporating cutting-edge technologies, such as augmented reality. With these advancements, cervical endoscopic spine surgery is poised to broaden its scope in treating cervical spine pathologies while maintaining the benefits of minimized tissue damage and rapid recovery.",

A 36-year-old male patient was complaining of chronic progressive lower back pain. He was found to have grade 2 L4/5 spondylolisthesis. We studied the feasibility of a trans-Kambin or a transfacet MIS-TLIF, and decided to proceed with the latter given the wider corridor it provides. Preoperative trajectory planning and level segmentation in addition to intraoperative navigation and image merging were all utilized to provide an AR model to guide us through the surgery.

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative spinal epidural hematomas (pSEHs) are a rare complication of microdiscectomy surgery. The hematoma may be unnoticed intraoperatively, but timely treatment may prevent permanent neurologic impairment. Airway management in patients with a full stomach is generally performed with rapid sequence intubation and general anesthesia. Awake spine surgery without intravenous analgesia or sedation may be beneficial in patients with a full stomach who are at higher risk for pulmonary aspiration with general anesthesia due to a loss of non-per-oral (NPO) status. The authors propose that it can also be performed in cases of urgent/emergent postsurgical epidural hematoma evacuation. METHODS: We present the airway management of a 41-year-old man who underwent a minimally invasive microdiscectomy with normal strength immediately after surgery but developed progressive weakness with right foot dorsiflexion, right extensor hallucis longus muscle weakness, and progressive right lower extremity ascending numbness over the course of the first 2 hours after surgery due to an epidural hematoma. RESULTS: The patient underwent urgent awake epidural hematoma evacuation with a spinal anesthetic. Afterward, the patient recovered neurological function and was discharged the following morning. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: pSEHs are a rare complication of microdiscectomy surgery. The purpose of this article is to describe the novel use of awake spine surgery in emergent epidural hematoma evacuation and demonstrate its feasibility. CONCLUSIONS: In emergencies, when a patient is not NPO, awake spine surgery can safely be performed with no sedation, ensuring the patient can protect their airway and avoid the risk of aspiration.",

                  "abstract": "The Prone Transpsoas (PTP) approach to lumbar spine surgery, emerging as an evolution of lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF), offers significant advantages over traditional methods. PTP has demonstrated increased lumbar lordosis gains compared to LLIF, owing to the natural increase in lordosis afforded by prone positioning. Additionally, the prone position offers anatomical advantages, with shifts in the psoas muscle and lumbar plexus, reducing the likelihood of postoperative femoral plexopathy and moving critical peritoneal contents away from the approach. Furthermore, operative efficiency is a notable benefit of PTP. By eliminating the need for intraoperative position changes, PTP reduces surgical time, which in turn decreases the risk of complications and operative costs. Finally, its versatility extends to various lumbar pathologies, including degeneration, adjacent segment disease, and deformities. The growing body of evidence indicates that PTP is at least as safe as traditional approaches, with a potentially better complication profile. In this narrative review, we review the historical evolution of lateral interbody fusion, culminating in the prone transpsoas approach. We also describe several adjuncts of PTP, including robotics and radiation-reduction methods. Finally, we illustrate the versatility of PTP and its uses, ranging from 'simple' degenerative cases to complex deformity surgeries.",

Wound healing complications are the most common reason for reoperation in this population and are known to impact quality of life and initiation of adjuvant therapy. Prophylactic muscle flap (MF) closure is known to reduce wound healing complications in high-risk patients; however, the efficacy in oncologic spine patients is not well established. METHODS: A collaboration at our institution presented an opportunity to study the outcomes of prophylactic MF closure. The authors performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent MF closure versus a cohort who underwent non-MF closure in the preceding time. Demographic and baseline health data were collected, as were postoperative wound complication data. RESULTS: A total of 166 patients were enrolled, including 83 patients in the MF cohort and 83 control patients. Patients in the MF group were more likely to smoke ( P = 0.005) and had a higher incidence of prior spine irradiation ( P = 0.002). Postoperatively, five patients (6%) in the MF group developed wound complications, compared with 14 patients (17%) in the control group ( P = 0.028). The most common overall complication was wound dehiscence requiring conservative therapy, which occurred in six control patients (7%) and one MF patient (1%) ( P = 0.053). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic MF closure during oncologic spine surgery significantly reduces the wound complication rate. Future studies should examine the precise patient population that stands to benefit most from this intervention. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.",

However, due to its novelty, there are limited data regarding the long-term benefits of this procedure. Our objective was to determine the long-term efficacy and durability of the percutaneous insertion of an expandable titanium cage through Kambin's triangle without facetectomy. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing percLIF via Kambin's triangle using an expandable titanium cage was performed. Demographics, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), radiographic measurements, perioperative variables, and complications were recorded. VAS, ODI, and radiographic measurements were compared with baseline using the generalized estimating equations assuming normally distributed data. Fusion was assessed with computed tomography (CT) at 1 and 2 years after the procedure. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were included. Spondylolisthesis, lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope, pelvic tilt, and anterior/posterior disc space height were all significantly improved postoperatively at each time point of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months (P < 0.001). Pelvic incidence-LL mismatch decreased significantly at each follow-up (P < 0.001) with a mean reduction of 4° by 24 months. VAS back scores reduced by >2 points at the 6, 12, and 24 month follow-ups. ODI scores reduced by >15 points at the 12- and 24-month follow-ups. Of the patients who had 1- and 2-year CT images, fusion rates at those time points were 94.4% (17/18) and 87.5% (7/8), respectively. The mean annual rate of surgically significant adjacent segment disease was 2.74% through an average follow-up of 2.74 years. CONCLUSION: These results highlight that percLIF, a procedure done without an endoscope or facetectomy, can be performed using an expandable titanium cage through Kambin's triangle with excellent radiographic and clinical results. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: percLIF via Kambin's triangle is a safe and succesful procedure with long-term improvements in both clinical and radiographic outcomes.",

                  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is among the most common spine procedures. Adjacent segment disease (ASD), characterized by degenerative disease at an adjacent spinal level to a prior fusion, is a well-recognized and significant sequela following ACDF. Adjacent segment ACDF may be considered after the failure of non-surgical options for patients with symptomatic ASD. This study aimed to assess the incidence of dysphagia and other complications as well as radiographic outcomes in adult patients who have undergone ACDF with an integrated interbody spacer device for symptomatic ASD. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients who underwent ACDF for symptomatic ASD with commercially available integrated interbody spacers by three spine surgeons at an academic institution from March 2018 to April 2022. Demographic, radiographic, and postoperative data were collected, including dysphagia, device-related complications, and the need for revision surgery. RESULTS: There were 48 patients (26 male, 22 female) who met inclusion criteria (mean age 59.7 years, mean body mass index 19.5 kg/m2) who underwent ACDF for symptomatic ASD (1one-level, n = 44; 2-level, n = 4). Overall, 12 patients (25%) experienced dysphagia postoperatively before the first follow-up appointment. Nine of 44 (20.4%) of 1-level ACDF patients experienced dysphagia, and 3 of 4 (75%) of 2-level ACDF patients experienced dysphagia. Three patients had severe dysphagia which prompted an otolaryngology referral. Two of those patients remained symptomatic at 6 weeks postoperatively. Of 43 patients with prior plate cage systems, none required hardware removal at the time of surgery. Preoperative global and segmental lordosis were 9.07° ± 8.36° (P = 0.22) and 3.58° ± 4.57° (P = 0.14), respectively. At 6 weeks postoperatively, global and segmental lordosis were 11.44° ± 9.06° (P = 0.54) and 5.11° ± 4.44° (P = 0.44), respectively. This constitutes a change of +2.37° and +1.53° in global and segmental lordosis, respectively. The mean anterior disc height change between preoperative and immediate postoperative time points was 6.3 ± 3.1 mm. Between the immediate postoperative and 6-week postoperative time points, the mean anterior disc height change was -1.5 ± 2.7 mm. Between the immediate postoperative and 3-month postoperative time points, the mean anterior disc height change was -3.7 ± 5.0 mm. The posterior disc height changes at the same time points were 2.5 ± 1.7 mm, -0.4 ± 1.8. and -0.5 ± 1.4 mm, respectively. This fusion rate was 50% and 70% at 6 months and 1 year post-surgery, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ACDF with integrated spacer is a viable alternative to traditional plate-cage systems for symptomatic ASD. An advantage over traditional plate-cage systems is that the removal of prior instrumentation is not needed in order to place implants. Based on a review of the literature, these standalone systems allowed for a shorter operative time and had less incidence of dysphagia than plate-cage systems for ASD after ACDF. The different standalone and plate-cage systems used in treating ASD after ACDF surgeries should be compared in prospective studies.",

                  "abstract": "Hip fractures are devastating injuries for the elderly and an increasing burden to the healthcare system. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), as a common cause of disability, instability, and falls in the elderly population, places patients at risk for hip fracture, and myelopathic patients are associated with increased complications after hip surgery. Myelopathy's relationship with hip fractures and impact, however, is not well understood. This study sought to 1) determine the prevalence of CSM among hip fracture patients and 2) hypothesized that hip fractures in CSM patients were associated with greater complexity and costs. In this institutional review board-exempt study, Medicare 1) hip fracture and 2) CSM patients between 2004 and 2014 were identified using the PearlDiver Patient Records Database (PearlDiver Technologies, Inc., CO) with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, (ICD-9) and Common Procedural Terminology codes. The prevalence of CSM within hip fracture patients was calculated, as was the incidence of hip fractures within CSM patients during this period. Hip fracture patients with CSM were compared with non-CSM hip fracture patients by age, medical comorbidities, average charges/payments, and average lengths of stay (LOS). Hip fracture patients with CSM who underwent cervical surgery were also compared with those who did not undergo cervical surgery, both before and after hip fracture. Statistical analysis with t-test and chi-squared test was performed, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. Total 22,884 of 2,309,972 hip fracture patients (1.0%) from 2004 to 2014 also had CSM, representing approximately 9900 cases per million persons, higher than previous estimates of the CSM incidence in the general population. These 22,884 hip fracture patients were 4.6% of 496,939 patients with CSM diagnosed during this period, representing a hip fracture incidence of 419 cases per 100,000 persons/year, also higher than previous estimates of hip fracture incidence in the overall population. Hip fracture patients with CSM were significantly younger (P < 0.001) but had significantly greater incidence of hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, obesity, tobacco use, diabetes, and osteoporosis (P < 0.001) than non-CSM counterparts, as well as significantly greater average hip fracture-related LOS, per-patient charges, and per-patient payments (P < 0.001). Within this group of hip fractures with CSM, 441 patients (441/22,884; 1.9%) underwent cervical surgery prior to hip fracture, and 245 patients (245/22,884; 1.1%) underwent cervical surgery after hip fracture. These surgically treated patients with CSM were significantly younger but had higher incidence of medical comorbidities (P < 0.001) relative to hip fracture patients with CSM who did not receive cervical surgery at any point. Surgically treated CSM patients also had significantly lower per-patient charges and costs related to their hip fracture care relative to CSM patients with hip fracture who did not receive cervical surgery (P = 0.43, 0.84). This study describes for the first time a high prevalence of CSM in hip fracture patients on a populational level. The 1) prevalence of CSM among hip fracture patients and 2) incidence of hip fractures among CSM patients in this study far exceeded previous epidemiologic estimates. Hip fracture patients with CSM were seen to be significantly younger than hip fracture patients without CSM yet also were seen to have significantly more medical complexity. Hip fracture patients with CSM were also seen to have significantly greater per-patient costs and hip fracture related LOS, findings that are belied by low rates of surgical myelopathy treatment following hip fracture.

However, there is a paucity of information in the literature on the complications of this procedure, with all published data consisting of small samples. We aimed to report the intraoperative and postoperative complications of PTP in the largest study to date.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective electronic medical record review was conducted at 11 centers to identify consecutive patients who underwent LLIF through the PTP approach between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. The following data were collected: intraoperative characteristics (operative time, estimated blood loss [EBL], intraoperative complications [anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) rupture, cage subsidence, vascular and visceral injuries]), postoperative complications, and hospital stay.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 365 patients were included in the study. Among these patients, 2.2% had ALL rupture, 0.3% had cage subsidence, 0.3% had a vascular injury, 0.3% had a ureteric injury, and no other visceral injuries were reported. Mean operative time was 226.2 ± 147.9 minutes. Mean EBL was 138.4 ± 215.6 mL. Mean hospital stay was 2.7 ± 2.2 days. Postoperative complications included new sensory symptoms-8.2%, new lower extremity weakness-5.8%, wound infection-1.4%, cage subsidence-0.8%, psoas hematoma-0.5%, small bowel obstruction and ischemia-0.3%, and 90-day readmission-1.9%.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this multicenter case series, the PTP approach was well tolerated and associated with a satisfactory safety profile.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The number of articles retracted by peer-reviewed journals has increased in recent years. This study systematically reviews retracted publications in the spine surgery literature. METHODS: A search of PubMed MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Retraction Watch, and the independent websites of 15 spine surgery-related journals from inception to September of 2022 was performed without language restrictions. PRISMA guidelines were followed with title/abstract screening, and full-text screening was conducted independently and in duplicate by two reviewers. Study characteristics and bibliometric information for each publication was extracted. RESULTS: Of 250 studies collected from the search, 65 met the inclusion criteria. The most common reason for retraction was data error (n = 15, 21.13%), followed by plagiarism (n = 14, 19.72%) and submission to another journal (n = 14, 19.72%). Most studies pertained to degenerative pathologies of the spine (n = 32, 80.00%). Most articles had no indication of retraction in their manuscript (n = 24, 36.92%), while others had a watermark or notice at the beginning of the article. The median number of citations per retracted publication was 10.0 (IQR 3-29), and the median 4-year impact factor of the journals was 5.05 (IQR 3.20-6.50). On multivariable linear regression, the difference in years from publication to retraction (p = 0.0343, β = 6.56, 95% CI 0.50-12.62) and the journal 4-year impact factor (p = 0.0029, β = 7.47, 95% CI 2.66-12.28) were positively associated with the total number of citations per retracted publication. Most articles originated from China (n = 30, 46.15%) followed by the United States (n = 12, 18.46%) and Germany (n = 3, 4.62%). The most common study design was retrospective cohort studies (n = 14, 21.54%). CONCLUSIONS: The retraction of publications has increased in recent years in spine surgery. Researchers consulting this body of literature should remain vigilant. Institutions and journals should collaborate to increase publication transparency and scientific integrity.",

Anterior column realignment (ACR) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative for restoring segmental lordosis. This technique involves a lateral approach and release of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL), followed by placement of a hyperlordotic interbody cage. In this study, we present a successful case of minimally invasive ACR for the treatment of flatback deformity and adjacent segment disease in a patient with prior L2-S1 fusion. Imaging revealed a flatback deformity, sagittal vertical axis elevation, and spinopelvic disharmony. The patient underwent a multistage procedure involving a lateral retropleural approach for ACR and interbody fusion, followed by open posterior instrumented fusion and vertebroplasties. Postoperatively, the patient experienced significant pain relief and improvement in lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt, and pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch. ACR combined with posterior release allows for manipulation of all three spinal columns, leading to spine reconstruction and improved spinopelvic harmony. We discuss the advantages of ACR, including its minimally invasive nature and potential benefits for patients with sagittal deformities. The presented surgical technique demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of minimally invasive ACR in addressing flatback deformity and adjacent segment disease.",

                  "abstract": "Only 100 years ago, traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) was commonly lethal. Today, most people who sustain SCI survive with continual efforts to improve their quality of life and neurological outcomes. SCI epidemiology is changing as preventative interventions reduce injuries in younger individuals, and there is an increased incidence of incomplete injuries in aging populations. Early treatment has become more intensive with decompressive surgery and proactive interventions to improve spinal cord perfusion. Accurate data, including specialized outcome measures, are crucial to understanding the impact of epidemiological and treatment trends. Dedicated SCI clinical research and data networks and registries have been established in the United States, Canada, Europe, and several other countries. We review four registry networks: the North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) SCI Registry, the National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) Database, the Rick Hansen SCI Registry (RHSCIR), and the European Multi-Center Study about Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI). We compare the registries' focuses, data platforms, advanced analytics use, and impacts. We also describe how registries' data can be combined with electronic health records (EHRs) or shared using federated analysis to protect registrants' identities. These registries have identified changes in epidemiology, recovery patterns, complication incidence, and the impact of practice changes such as early decompression. They've also revealed latent disease-modifying factors, helped develop clinical trial stratification models, and served as matched control groups in clinical trials. Advancing SCI clinical science for personalized medicine requires advanced analytical techniques, including machine learning, counterfactual analysis, and the creation of digital twins. Registries and other data sources help drive innovation in SCI clinical science.",

The study objective was to define different clinical manifestations of cSCI. Data were collected prospectively through centers of the North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN). Data was collected on 470 patients (21% women, mean age 50 years). Cervical vertebral level was analyzed as an ordinal variable to determine a natural demarcation to classify upper versus lower cSCI. For continuous variable analysis, falls were associated with C3 more than C4 vertebral level injuries (60% vs. 42%; p = 0.0126), while motor vehicle accidents were associated with C4 more than C3 (40% vs. 29%; p = 0.0962). Motor International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury scores also demonstrated a natural demarcation between C3 and C4, with C3 having higher median American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores (40 [4-73] vs. 11 [3-59], p = 0.0227). There were no differences when comparing C2 to C3 nor C4 to C5. Given the significant differences seen between C3 and C4, but not C2 and C3 nor C4 and C5, upper cSCI was designated as C1-C3, and lower cSCI was designated as C4-C7. Compared with a lower cSCI, patients with an upper cSCI were more likely to have a fall as their mechanism of injury (54% vs. 36%; p = 0.0072). Patients with an ASIA C cSCI were likely to have an upper cervical injury: 23% vs. 11% (p = 0.0226). Additionally, patients with an upper cSCI were more likely to have diabetes prior to injury: 37% versus 22%, respectively (p = 0.0084). Lower cSCI were more likely injured through sports (19% vs. 8%, p = 0.0171) and present with ASIA A (42% vs. 25%, p = 0.0186) neurological grade. Patients with lower cSCI were also significantly more likely to have complications such as shock, pulmonary embolism, and pleural effusion. In conclusion, there appears to be a natural demarcation of injury type between C3 and C4. Upper cSCI (C1-C3) was more associated with falls and diabetes, whereas lower cSCI (C4-C7) was more associated with sports, worse ASIA scores, and more complications. Further research will be needed to understand the mechanistic and biological differences between these two groups and whether different treatments may be appropriate for each of these groups.",

The North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) for Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a consortium of tertiary medical centers that includes a prospective SCI registry. The NACTN registry data was analyzed to evaluate the prognostic implication of the BCR during the initial evaluation of a spinal cord injury patient. SCI patients were divided into those with an intact or absent BCR during their initial evaluation. Associations of participants' descriptors and neurological status on follow-up were performed, followed by associations with the presence of a BCR. A total of 769 registry patients with recorded BCRs were included in the study. The median age was 49 years (32-61 years), and the majority were male (n = 566, 77%) and white (n = 519, 73%). Among included patients, high blood pressure was the most common comorbidity (n = 230, 31%). Cervical spinal cord injury was the most common (n = 470, 76%) with fall (n = 320, 43%) being the most frequent mechanism of injury. BCR was present in 311 patients (40.4%), while 458 (59.6%) had a negative BCR within 7 days of injury or before surgery. At 6 months post-injury, 230 patients (29.9%) followed up, of which 145 had a positive BCR, while 85 had a negative BCR. The presence/absence of BCR was significantly different in patients with cervical (p = 0.0015) or thoracic SCI (p = 0.0089), or conus medullaris syndrome (p = 0.0035), and in those who were American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade A (p = 0.0313). No significant relationship was observed between BCR results and demographics, AIS grade conversion, motor score changes (p = 0.1669), and changes in pin prick (p = 0.3795) and light touch scores (p = 0.8178). In addition, cohorts were not different in surgery decision (p = 0.7762) and injury to surgery time (p = 0.0681). In our review of the NACTN spinal cord registry, the BCR did not provide prognostic utility in the acute evaluation of spinal cord injury patients. Therefore, it should not be used as a reliable marker for predicting neurological outcomes post-injury.",

It has previously been shown that initial presentation to a lower acuity center and necessity of transfer to a higher acuity center reduce rates of early surgery. The NACTN database was evaluated to examine the association between interhospital transfer (IHT), early surgery, and outcome, taking into account distance traveled and site of origin for the patient. Data from a 15-year period of the NACTN SCI Registry were analyzed (years 2005-2019). Patients were stratified into transfers directly from the scene to a Level 1 trauma center (NACTN site) versus IHT from a Level 2 or 3 trauma facility. The main outcome was surgery within 24 hours of injury (yes/no), whereas secondary outcomes were length of stay, death, discharge disposition, and 6-month American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade conversion. For the IHT patients, distance traveled for transfer was calculated by measuring the shortest distance between origin and NACTN hospital. Analysis was performed with Brown-Mood test and chi-square tests. Of 724 patients with transfer data, 295 (40%) underwent IHT and 429 (60%) were admitted directly from the scene of injury. Patients who underwent IHT were more likely to have a less severe SCI (AIS D; p = 0.002), have a central cord injury (p = 0.004), and have a fall as their mechanism of injury (p < 0.0001) than those directly admitted to an NACTN center. Of the 634 patients who had surgery, direct admission to an NACTN site was more likely to result in surgery within 24 hours compared with IHT patients (52% vs. 38%) (p < 0.0003). Median IHT distance was 28 miles (interquartile range [IQR] = 13-62 miles). There was no significant difference in death, length of stay, discharge to a rehab facility versus home, or 6-month AIS grade conversion rates between the two groups. Patients who underwent IHT to an NACTN site were less likely to have surgery within 24 hours of injury, compared with those directly admitted to the Level 1 trauma facility. Although there was no difference in mortality rates, length of stay, or 6-month AIS conversion between groups, patients with IHT were more likely be older with a less severe level of injury (AIS D). This study suggests there are barriers to timely recognition of SCI in the field, appropriate admission to a higher level of care after recognition, and challenges related to the management of individuals with less severe SCI.",

For early surgery to be accomplished, understanding the causes of variabilities that effect the timing of surgery is needed to achieve this goal. The purpose of this analysis is to determine factors that affect the timing of surgery for acute cervical SCI within the North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) for SCI registry. Patients in the NACTN SCI registry from 2005 to 2019 with a cervical SCI, excluding acute traumatic central cord syndrome, were analyzed for time elapsed from injury to arrival to the hospital, and time to surgery. Two categories were defined: 1) Early Arrival with Early Surgery (EAES) commenced within 24 h of injury, and 2) Early Arrival but Delayed Surgery (EADS), with surgery occurring between 24 to 72 h post-injury. Patients' demographic features, initial clinical evaluation, medical comorbidities, neurological status, surgical intervention, complications, and outcome data were correlated with respect to the two arrival groups. Of the 222 acute cervical SCI patients undergoing surgery, 163 (73.4%) were EAES, and 59 (26.6%) were EADS. There was no statistical difference in arrival time between the EAES and EADS groups. There was a statistical difference in the median arrival time to surgery between the EAES group (9 h) compared with the EADS group (31 h; p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in race, sex, age, mechanism of injury, Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, or medical comorbidities between the two groups, but the EAES group did present with a significantly lower systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05). EADS patients were more likely to present as an American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) D than EAES (p < 0.05). Early surgery was statistically more likely to occur if the injury occurred over the weekend (p < 0.05). There were variations in the rates of early surgery between the eight NACTN sites within the study, ranging from 57 to 100%. Of the 114 patients with 6-month outcome data, there was no significant change between the two groups regarding AIS grade change and motor/pin prick/light touch score recovery. A trend towards improved motor scores with early surgery was not statistically significant (p = 0.21). Although there is data that surgery within 24 h of injury improves outcomes and can be performed safely, there remain variations in care outside of clinical trials. In the present study of cervical SCI, NACTN achieved its goal of early surgery in 73.4% of patients from 2005-2019 who arrived within 24 h of their injury. Variability in achieving this goal was related to severity of neurological injury, the day of the week, and the treating NACTN center. Evaluating variations within our network improves understanding of potential systemic limitations and our decision-making process to accomplish the goal of early surgery.",

Traditionally, spinopelvic fixation for unstable sacral fractures was performed with open reduction and fixation, but robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgical methods now present new, less invasive approaches. The objective here was to present a series of patients with traumatic sacral fractures treated with robotic-assisted minimally invasive spinopelvic fixation and discuss early experience, considerations, and technical challenges. METHODS: Between June 2022 and January 2023, 7 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. Intraoperative fluoroscopic images were merged with intraoperative computed tomography images using a robotic system to plan the trajectories for placement of bilateral lumbar pedicle and iliac screws. Intraoperative computed tomography was performed after pedicle and pelvic screw insertion to confirm appropriate placement before insertion of rods percutaneously without the need for a side connector. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 7 patients (4 female, 3 male) with ages ranging from 20 to 74. Intraoperatively, the mean blood loss was 85.7 ± 84.0 mL, and mean operative time was 178.4 ± 63.9 minutes. There were no complications in 6 patients; 1 patient experienced both a medially breached pelvic screw and a complicated rod pullout. All patients were safely discharged to their homes or an acute rehabilitation facility. CONCLUSIONS: Our early experience reveals that robotic-assisted minimally invasive spinopelvic fixation for traumatic sacral fractures is a safe and feasible treatment option with the potential to improve outcomes and reduce complications.",

Our goal was to better understand how pathology can affect Kambin's Triangle, thereby altering the laterality of approach for percutaneous lumbar interbody fusion (percLIF). METHODS: The authors performed a single-center retrospective review of patients evaluated for percLIF. The areas of Kambin's Triangle were measured without and with nerve segmentation. For the latter, the lumbosacral nerve roots on 3-dimensional T2 magnetic resonance imaging were manually segmented. Next, the borders of Kambin's Triangle were delineated, ensuring no overlap between the area and nerve above. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (67.5 ± 9.7 years, 46.7% female) were retrospectively reviewed. We measured 150 Kambin's Triangles. The mean areas from L1-S1 were 50.0 ± 12.3 mm2, 73.8 ± 12.5 mm2, 83.8 ± 12.2 mm2, 88.5 ± 19.0 mm2, and 116 ± 29.3 mm2, respectively. When pathology was present, the areas significantly decreased at L4-L5 (P = 0.046) and L5-S1 (P = 0.049). Higher spondylolisthesis and smaller posterior disk heights were linked with decreased areas via linear regression analysis (P < 0.05). When nerve segmentation was used, the areas were significantly smaller from L1-L5 (P < 0.05). Among 11 patients who underwent surgery, none suffered from postoperative neuropathies. CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate the feasibility of preoperatively segmenting lumbosacral nerves and measuring Kambin's Triangle to help guide surgical planning and determine the ideal laterality of approach for percLIF.",

Here, we find that ependymal cells in zebrafish spinal cords produce the neurogenic factor Hb-egfa upon transection injury. Animals with hb-egfa mutations display defective swim capacity, axon crossing, and tissue bridging after spinal cord transection, associated with disrupted indicators of neuron production. Local recombinant human HB-EGF delivery alters ependymal cell cycling and tissue bridging, enhancing functional regeneration. Epigenetic profiling reveals a tissue regeneration enhancer element (TREE) linked to hb-egfa that directs gene expression in spinal cord injuries. Systemically delivered recombinant AAVs containing this zebrafish TREE target gene expression to crush injuries of neonatal, but not adult, murine spinal cords. Moreover, enhancer-based HB-EGF delivery by AAV administration improves axon densities after crush injury in neonatal cords. Our results identify Hb-egf as a neurogenic factor necessary for innate spinal cord regeneration and suggest strategies to improve spinal cord repair in mammals.",

The authors set out to investigate the effects of SA versus general anesthesia (GA) for spinal fusion procedures on length of stay (LOS), opioid use, time to ambulation (TTA), and procedure duration. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of a single surgeon's patients who underwent lumbar fusions under SA versus GA from June of 2020 to June of 2022. SA patients were compared to demographically matched GA counterparts undergoing comparable procedures. Analyzed outcomes include operative time, opioid usage in morphine milligram equivalents, TTA, and LOS. RESULTS: Ten SA patients were matched to 10 GA counterparts. The cohort had a mean age of 66.77, a mean body mass index of 27.73 kg/m2, and a median American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Score of 3.00. LOS was lower in SA versus GA patients (12.87 vs. 50.79 hours, P = 0.001). Opioid utilization was reduced in SA versus GA patients (10.76 vs. 31.43 morphine milligram equivalents, P = 0.006). TTA was reduced in SA versus GA patients (7.22 vs. 29.87 hours, P = 0.022). Procedure duration was not significantly reduced in SA patients compared to GA patients (139.3 vs. 188.2 minutes, P = 0.089). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary retrospective results suggest the use of SA rather than GA for lumbar fusions is associated with reduced hospital LOS, reduced opioid utilization, and reduced TTA. Future randomized prospective studies are warranted to determine if SA usage truly leads to these beneficial outcomes.",

This represents only a fraction of patients that present for surgical consideration. Procedures are often avoided due to comorbidities that make patients poor candidates for general anesthesia (GA) and its associated risks. With increasing interest in awake surgery under spinal anesthesia (SA), the authors have observed that SA may facilitate spine surgery in patients with relative contraindications to GA. With this in mind, the authors set out to summarize the outcomes of a series of highly comorbid patients who received surgery under SA. METHODS: Case logs of a single surgeon were reviewed, and patients undergoing spine surgery under SA were identified. Within this group, patients were identified with relative contraindications to GA, such as advanced age and medical comorbidities. For these patients, for whom surgery was facilitated by SA, the medical records were consulted to report demographic information and patient outcomes. RESULTS: Ten highly comorbid patients were identified who received lumbar spine surgery for DSD under SA. Comorbidities included octogenarian status, obesity, and chronic health conditions such as heart disease. The cohort had a mean age of 75.5 and a mean American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) score of 3.1. The patients were predicted to have a 2.74-fold increase of serious complications compared to the average patient. There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: For patients with symptomatic, refractory DSD and relative contraindications to GA, SA may facilitate safe surgical intervention with excellent outcomes.",

METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous thoracic and lumbosacral spinal instrumentation were retrospectively enrolled. Instrumentation was performed using either fluoroscopy-based instrument tracking system (TrackX, TrackX Technologies) or robotic-navigation (ExcelsiusGPS, Globus Medical). Postinstrumentation computed tomography scans were graded for breach according to the Gertzbein-Robbins scale, with \"acceptable\" screws deemed as Grade A or B and \"unacceptable\" screws deemed as Grades C through E. Accuracy data was compared between both instrumentation modalities. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients, comprising a total of 250 screws (167 robot, 83 instrument tracking) were included. The overall accuracy between both modalities was similar, with 96.4% and 97.6% of screws with acceptable accuracy between instrument tracking and robotic navigation, respectively (I-squared 0.30, df = 1, P = 0.58). Between instrument tracking and robotic navigation, 92.8% and 95.8% of screws received Grade A, 3.6% and 1.8% a Grade B, 1.2% and 1.2% a Grade C, 1.2% and 0.6% a Grade D, and 1.2% and 0.6% a Grade E, respectively. The robot was abandoned intraoperatively in 2 cases due to unrecoverable registration inaccuracy or software failure, leading to abandonment of 8 potential screws (4.8%). CONCLUSIONS: In a similar patient population, there is a similarly high degree of instrumentation accuracy between fluoroscopy-based instrument tracking and robotic navigation. There is a rare chance for screw breach with either surgical adjunct.",

By leveraging spinal anesthesia, surgeons may safely conduct surgeries on one- or two-level lumbar pathology. However, surgeries on more extensive pathology have not yet been described, because of concerns about the duration of efficacy of spinal anesthetic in the awake patient. OBJECTIVE: To report the use of a novel awake technique for \"in parallel,\" simultaneous lumbar spinal surgery on three-segment pathology. METHODS: We describe concurrent performance of a dual microscopic, navigated MIS TLIF and MIS two-level decompression, using a combination of liposomal bupivacaine erector spinae block in conjunction with a spinal anesthetic. RESULTS: We show that a left-sided, two-level MIS tubular microscopic decompression combined with a concurrent right-sided, transfacet MIS TLIF via a tubular microscopic approach was well tolerated in an 87-year-old patient with multilevel lumbar stenosis with a mobile spondylolisthesis. CONCLUSION: We provide the first description of a dual-surgeon approach for minimally invasive spine surgery. This \"in-parallel\" technique-reliant on 2, independent spine surgeons-may aid in the performance of surgeries previously considered too extensive, given the time constraints of regional anesthesia and can be successfully applied to patients who otherwise may not be candidates for general anesthesia.",

Currently, these scans are performed separately, and surgeons then use fluoroscopy or neuromonitoring to guide instruments through Kambin's triangle. However, anatomic variations and intraoperative positional changes are possible, meaning that safely accessing Kambin's triangle remains a challenge because nerveroot visualization without endoscopes has not been thoroughly described. OBJECTIVE: To overcome the known challenges of percLIF and reduce the likelihood of iatrogenic injuries by showing real-time locations of neural and bony anatomy. METHODS: The authors demonstrate an intraoperative navigational platform that applies nerve root segmentation and image fusion to assist with percLIF. Five patients from a single institution were included. RESULTS: Of the 5 patients, the mean age was 71 ± 8 years and 3 patients (60%) were female. One patient had general anesthesia while the remaining 4 patients underwent awake surgery with spinal anesthesia. The mean area for the L4-L5 Kambin's triangle was 76.1 ± 14.5 mm 2 . A case example is shown where the side of approach was based on the fact that Kambin's triangle was larger on one side compared with the other. The mean operative time was 170 ± 17 minutes, the mean blood loss was 32 ± 16 mL, and the mean hospital length of stay was 19.6 ± 8.3 hours. No patients developed postoperative complications.

We aim to compare robot-assisted pelvic screw fixation to the traditional fluoroscopy-assisted technique with regards to intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used along with a search of electronic information to identify all studies comparing the outcomes of robot-assisted versus conventional screw fixation in patients with posterior pelvic ring injuries. Primary outcomes included operative duration (minutes), intraoperative bleeding (mL), fluoroscopy exposure and intraoperative drilling frequency. Secondary outcome measures included Majeed score, healing time (minutes) and rate (%), postoperative complications, screw positioning, incision length (cm) and guide wire insertion times (minutes). The random effects model was used for analysis. RESULTS: Four observational studies including a total of 294 patients were identified. There was a significant difference between robot-assisted and conventional groups in terms of operative duration (MD = - 24.66, p < 0.05), intraoperative bleeding (MD = - 10.37, P < 0.05), fluoroscopy exposure (MD = - 2.15, P < 0.05) and intraoperative drilling frequency (MD = - 2.42, P =  < 0.05). For secondary outcomes, no significant difference was seen in Majeed score, healing time and rate and postoperative complications. The robot-assisted group had better screw positioning, smaller incision length, and shorter anaesthesia and guide wire insertion times. CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted fixation has superior intraoperative outcomes compared to conventional fixation. Further studies are needed to look at postoperative outcomes as there is no significant difference in postoperative prognosis between the techniques.",

A 75-year-old man presented with prior L3-L5 fusion and progressive lower extremity pain and weakness. Using the described techniques, the patient underwent a lateral retroperitoneal interbody fusion and posterior instrumentation at L2-L3. The operation proceeded without complication, and the patient reported improved ambulation at 6-week follow-up. The prone lateral transpsoas approach and minimally invasive posterior instrumentation for lumbar interbody fusion permits effective fusion without significant posterior muscle disruption from a single position. The integration of virtual live fluoroscopy enables real-time instrument tracking throughout the minimally invasive case, with reductions in patient and surgeon radiation exposure. Video 1 depicts the use and benefits of this technology in lateral spine surgery. Compared with computed tomography-guided navigation, virtual live fluoroscopy technology enables rapid remapping to iatrogenic anatomic changes for more fluid progression through the operation.5 Virtual live fluoroscopy instrument tracking is a valuable tool that increases the safety and efficiency of single-position lateral spine surgery.",

This compiled knowledge of the triangle is needed to perform successful procedures, reduce nerve root injuries, and help guide surgeons in training. METHODS: The authors performed a search of multiple databases using combinations of keywords: Kambin's triangle, size, measurement, safe triangle, and bony triangle. Articles were included if their main findings included measurement of Kambin's triangle. The PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, Cochrane, Embase, and Medline databases were systematically searched for English-language articles with no time frame restrictions through July 2022. RESULTS: Eight studies comprising 132 patients or cadavers were included in the study. The mean ± SD age was 66.69 ± 9.6 years, and 53% of patients were male. Overall, the size of Kambin's triangle increased in area moving down vertebral levels, with L5-S1 being the largest (133.59 ± 4.36 mm2). This trend followed a linear regression model when SAP was kept (p = 0.008) and removed (p = 0.003). There was also a considerable increase in the size of Kambin's triangle if the SAP was removed. CONCLUSIONS: Here, the authors have provided the first reported systematic review of the literature of Kambin's triangle, its measurements at each lumbar level, and key areas of debate related to the definition of the working safe zone. These findings indicate that CT is heavily utilized for imaging of the safe zone, the area of Kambin's triangle tends to increase caudally, and variation exists between patients. Future studies should focus on using advanced imaging techniques for preoperative planning and establishing guidelines for surgeons.",

METHODS: A multicenter retrospective observational cohort study was performed for all patients who underwent lateral lumber interbody fusion via the single-position prone transpsoas (PTP) approach. Spinopelvic parameters from preoperative and first upright postoperative radiographs were collected, including lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), and pelvic tilt (PT). Functional indices (visual analog scale score), and patient-reported outcomes (Oswestry Disability Index) were also recorded from pre- and postoperative appointments. RESULTS: Of the 363 patients who successfully underwent the procedure, LL after fusion was 50.0° compared with 45.6° preoperatively (p < 0.001). The pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch (PI-LL) was 10.5° preoperatively versus 2.9° postoperatively (p < 0.001). PT did not significantly change (0.2° ± 10.7°, p > 0.05).

The differential diagnosis for spinal disease is broad both in terms of anatomic localization and pathologic mechanism. The goal of this chapter is to explore spine pathology by placing disorders into characteristic frameworks that a clinician can use to evaluate a patient. The chapter focuses on symptom-driven diagnosis and care and separates disorders by clinical presentation, discussing pathologies that can contribute to these presentations. To arrive at a differential diagnosis, one must acquire patient history, examination, laboratory, and imaging data; create a problem or clinical presentation; and then adapt a framework for the types of disorders that could cause that presentation. We split up the framework into degenerative, deformity, traumatic, oncologic, inflammatory, and toxic/metabolic etiologies.",

EMG monitoring has been deemed particularly useful in the minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. A more recent evolution of the minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion entails complete percutaneous access to the disc through Kambin's triangle, followed by a percutaneous lumbar interbody fusion. Given the lack of direct visualization of nervous structures with percutaneous entrance into the disc, there is risk of injury to surrounding nervous structures with this approach. In effort to reduce risk of nerve injury, application of triggered EMG to gauge proximity of nervous tissue has been evaluated. Recently, patients presenting with contraindications or concerns for general anesthesia have been offered the alternative to undergo their procedure with spinal anesthesia, allowing them to remain awake. Spinal anesthesia entails intrathecal administration of local anesthetic, which mechanistically acts to reduce overall excitability of surrounding neural structures. However, nerve activation under conditions of local anesthetic is relatively unknown, and the ability of triggered EMG monitoring to reliably detect nerve proximity becomes questionable. This case report demonstrates nerve activation at thresholds comparable with those seen under general anesthesia. Although this has sparked interest in the possibility that local anesthetic may not remarkably affect nerve excitability as measured by triggered EMG activation, further investigation is recommended to reliably apply triggered EMG monitoring in awake spine surgery.",

The authors describe the feasibility, reproducibility and radiographic efficacy of PTP when performed for cases of lumbar ASD. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing PTP for treatment of lumbar ASD at three institutions were retrospectively enrolled. Demographic information was recorded, as was operative data such as adjacent segment levels, operative time, blood loss, laterality of approach, open versus percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation and need for primary decompression. Radiographic measurements including segmental and global lumbar lordosis, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, sacral slope and sagittal vertical axis were recorded both pre- and immediately post-operatively. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met criteria for inclusion. Average age was 60.4 ± 10.4 years and average BMI was 31.6 ± 5.0 kg/m2. Total operative time was 204.7 ± 83.3 min with blood loss of 187.9 ± 211 mL. Twenty-one patients had pedicle screw instrumentation exchanged percutaneously and 3 patients had open pedicle screw exchange. Two patients suffered pulmonary embolism that was treated medically with no long-term sequelae. One patient had transient lumbar radicular pain and all patients were discharged home with an average length of stay of 3.0 days (range 1-6). Radiographically, global lumbar lordosis improved by an average of 10.3 ± 9.0 degrees, segmental lordosis by 10.1 ± 13.3 degrees and sagittal vertical axis by 3.2 ± 3.2 cm. CONCLUSION: Single-position prone transpsoas lumbar interbody fusion is a clinically reproducible minimally invasive technique that can effectively treat lumbar adjacent segment disease.",

                  "abstract": "Physical rehabilitation is essential for enhancing recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI); however, aside from early surgical intervention and hemodynamic management, there are no proven interventions for promoting recovery in the acute phase. In general, early rehabilitation is considered beneficial, but optimal parameters and potential contraindications for implementing rehabilitation at very early time points are unclear. Moreover, clinical trials to date are limited to studies initiating rehabilitation 2 weeks after injury and later. To address these gaps, this article reviews the preclinical literature on physical interventions initiated within the first 8 days postinjury. Effects of early rehabilitation on molecular and structural nervous system changes, behavioral function, and body systems are considered. Most studies utilized treadmill or cycle training as the primary intervention. Treadmill training initiated within the first 3 days and terminated by 1 week after injury worsened autonomic function, inflammation, and locomotor outcomes, while swim training during this period increased microvascular dysfunction. In contrast, lower-intensity rehabilitation such as reach training, ladder training, or voluntary wheel or ball training showed benefits when implemented during the first 3 days. Rehabilitation initiated at 4 days postinjury was also associated with enhanced motor recovery. Cycling appears to have the greatest risk-benefit ratio; however, the effects of cycle training in the first 3 days were not investigated. Overall, research suggests that lower intensity or voluntary rehabilitation during the hyperacute phase is more appropriate until at least 4 days postinjury, at which point higher-intensity activity becomes safer and more beneficial for recovery.",

OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel application of robotic navigation to assist with minimally invasive SI joint fusion. METHODS: Patients undergoing stand-alone SI joint fusion with ExcelsiusGPS robotic navigation from July 2020 through June 2021 were retrospectively enrolled. Baseline demographic and perioperative variables including radiation exposure, postoperative pain scores, and narcotic requirements in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) were recorded. Length of stay and any postoperative complications were also noted. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients (64.4 ± 8.2 years, body mass index 28.7 ± 4.8 kg/m2) met inclusion criteria. Seven patients (70.0%) were female, and there was a 6:4 split between left-sided and right-sided SI joint fusion. The total operative time was 54 ± 9 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 21.0 ± 16.7 mL. The intraoperative radiation exposure was 13.7 ± 6.2 mGy, and there were no complications. The average pain score in PACU was 5.2 ± 1.0, and the average opioid administration in PACU was 27.6 ± 10.3 morphine equivalents. Length of stay was 0.4 ± 0.7 days, with 7 of 10 patients discharged on the same day as surgery. There were no readmissions. The average length of follow-up was 4.3 ± 2.5 months. At the last follow-up, patients reported an average of 73.1% ± 30.1% improvement in their preoperative pain. CONCLUSION: Robot-navigated SI joint fusion is a feasible and reproducible method for addressing refractory SI joint disease. Further investigation on clinical outcomes and long-term fusion rates is needed, as are studies comparing robot-navigated SI joint fusion with more traditional techniques.",

OBJECTIVES: Perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the perioperative utility of general versus spinal anesthesia in the lumbar spine surgery population. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were queried for manuscripts reporting perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing one to three-level lumbar spine surgery (including decompression, fusion, and decompression with fusion) using either general or spinal anesthesia. Inclusion criteria included studies published from 2005 to 2021, in English, involving primary data from human subjects. Studies were further screened for data on total operative time, blood loss, intraoperative hypotension, pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting, time required in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), PACU pain anesthetic requirement, and length of stay. Risk of bias for each study was assessed using standardized tools (i.e., RoB 2, ROBINS-I, NOS, as appropriate). Potential predictors of outcome were compared using univariate analysis, and variables potentially associated with outcome were subjected to meta-analysis using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel testing to produce standard mean differences (SMD) or odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In total, 12 studies totaling 2796 patients met inclusion criteria. 1414 (50.6%) and 1382 (49.4%) patients underwent lumbar spine surgery with general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia, respectively. Patients undergoing spinal anesthesia were statistically more likely to have coronary artery disease and respiratory dysfunction. Total operative time (SMD: 12.62 min, 95% CI -18.65 to -6.59), estimated blood loss (SMD: 0.57 mL, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.46), postoperative nausea and vomiting (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.26), time required in PACU (SMD = -0.20 min, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.08), and length of stay (SMD = -0.14 day, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.10), all statistically significantly favored spinal anesthesia over general anesthesia (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In one to three-level lumbar spine surgery, current literature supports spinal anesthesia as a viable alternative to general anesthesia.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify preoperative factors that impact the decision to perform prophylactic muscle flap closure and assess risk factors for wound healing complications in patients undergoing spinal procedures with and without muscle flap closure. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior studies suggest that muscle flap closure following complex spine surgery results in a lower risk of wound healing complications. However, these studies have been limited to single institutions and/or surgeons. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for all patients undergoing spine surgery between 2005 and 2017 with and without concomitant muscle flaps. Preoperative and perioperative variables were extracted. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess risk factors influencing surgical site infection (SSI) and wound disruption, as well as to delineate which preoperative factors increased the likelihood of patients receiving flap closures a priori. RESULTS: Concomitant muscle flaps were performed on 758 patients; 301,670 patients did not receive a flap. Overall 29 (3.83%) patients in the flap group experienced SSI compared to 5154 (1.71%) in the nonflap group (P<0.0001). Preoperative steroid use [odds ratio (OR) 0.5; P<0.0001], wound infection (OR 0.24; P<0.0001), elevated white blood cell count (OR 1.034; P<0.0001), low hematocrit (OR 0.94; P<0.0001), preoperative transfusion (OR 0.22; P=0.0068) were significantly associated with utilization of muscle flaps. Perioperative factors including a contaminated wound (OR 4.72; P<0.0001), the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification of severe disease (OR 1.92; P=0.024), and longer operative time (OR 1.001; P=0.0024) were significantly associated with postoperative wound disruption. In addition, after propensity score matching for these factors that increase risk of wound complications, there was no difference in the rates of SSI between the flap and nonflap group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patients with a higher burden of illness preoperatively are more likely to receive prophylactic paraspinal flaps which can reduce the rates of wound-related complications.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Despite tremendous advancements in biomedical science and surgical technique, spine surgeries are still associated with considerable rates of morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly. Multiple novel techniques have been employed in recent years to adequately treat spinal diseases while mitigating the perioperative morbidity associated with traditional spinal surgery. Some of these techniques include minimally invasive methods and novel anesthetic and analgesic methods. In recent years, awake spine surgery with spinal anesthesia has gained attention as an alternative to general anesthesia (GA). In this study, the authors retrospectively reviewed a single-institution Egyptian experience with awake spine surgery using spinal anesthesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Overall, 149 patients who were admitted to As-Salam International Hospital in Cairo for lumbar and lower thoracic spine surgeries, between 2019 and 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics and comorbidities were collected and analyzed. Visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were assessed at different time intervals including preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and 1 year postoperatively. Patient satisfaction was queried through a questionnaire assessing patient preference for traditional anesthesia or spinal anesthesia. RESULTS: Of the 149 patients who successfully received spine surgery with spinal anesthesia, there were 49 males and 100 females. The cohort age ranged from 22 to 85 years with a mean of 47.5 years. The operative time ranged from 45 to 300 minutes with a mean estimated blood loss (EBL) of 385 ± 156 mL. No major cardiopulmonary or intraoperative complications occurred, and patients were able to eat immediately after surgery. Patients were able to ambulate without an assistive device 6 to 8 hours after surgery. Decompression and fusion patients were discharged on postoperative days 2 and 3, respectively. VAS and ODI scores demonstrated excellent pain relief, which was maintained at the 1-year postoperative follow-up. No 30- or 90-day readmissions were recorded. Of 149 patients, 124 were satisfied with spinal anesthesia and would recommend spinal anesthesia to other patients. The remaining patients were not satisfied with spinal anesthesia but reported being pleased with their postoperative clinical and functional outcomes. One patient was converted to GA due to the duration of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received spinal anesthesia for awake spine surgery experienced short stays in the hospital, no readmissions, patient satisfaction, and well-controlled pain. The results of this study have validated the growing body of literature that demonstrates that awake spine surgery with spinal anesthesia is safe and associated with superior outcomes compared with traditional GA. Additionally, the ability to address chronic debilitating conditions, such as spinal conditions, with minimal use of valuable resources, such as ventilators, proved useful during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be a model should other stressors on healthcare systems arise, especially in developing areas of the world.",

In this study, we describe percutaneous access to the lumbar disc and insertion of an expandable titanium cage through Kambin's triangle without facetectomy. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility as well as clinical and radiographical outcomes of completely percutaneous lumbar interbody fusion (percLIF) using an expandable titanium cage through Kambin's triangle. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing single-level percLIF for grade 1 lumbar spondylolisthesis via Kambin's triangle using an expandable titanium cage was performed. Demographic information, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), preoperative and postoperative radiographic factors, perioperative data, and complications were recorded. Fusion was assessed with 1-year postoperative computed tomography scan or lumbar spine x-ray and defined as bridging disc or posterolateral fusion without evidence of hardware fracture or perihardware lucency. RESULTS: A total of 16 patients (3 males) were included in this study. Spondylolisthesis, anterior disc height, and posterior disc height were significantly improved at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months, postoperatively (P < 0.05). ODI was significantly improved by 24.4% at 12 months postoperatively (P = 0.0036). One patient was readmitted within 30 days for pain control but otherwise there were no complications including permanent neurological injury, infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac events. Fifteen (93.8%) patients had radiographic fusion at their 1-year postoperative imaging. CONCLUSION: Our initial experiences have shown that percLIF can be performed using an expandable titanium cage through Kambin's triangle with excellent radiographic and clinical results. In this series, percLIF is a safe and clinically efficacious procedure for reducing grade 1 lumbar spondylolisthesis and improving radiculopathy.

While RA pedicle screw placement has been extensively investigated, there is a lack of literature on the use of the robot for other tasks, such as accessing Kambin's triangle in percutaneous lumbar interbody fusion (percLIF). OBJECTIVE: To characterize the surgical feasibility and preliminary outcomes of an initial case series of 10 patients receiving percLIF with RA cage placement via Kambin's triangle. METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective review of patients undergoing RA percLIF using robot-guided trajectory to access Kambin's triangle for cage placement. Patients undergoing RA percLIF were eligible for enrollment. Baseline health and demographic information in addition to peri- and postoperative data was collected. The dimensions of each patient's Kambin's triangle were measured. RESULTS: Ten patients and 11 levels with spondylolisthesis were retrospectively reviewed. All patients successfully underwent the planned procedure without perioperative complications. Four patients underwent their procedure with awake anesthesia. The average dimension of Kambin's triangle was 66.3 m2. With the exception of 1 patient who stayed in the hospital for 7 d, the average length of stay was 1.2 d, with 2 patients discharged the day of surgery. No patients suffered postoperative motor or sensory deficits. Spinopelvic parameters and anterior and posterior disc heights were improved with surgery. CONCLUSION: As MISS continues to evolve, further exploration of robot-guided surgical practice, such as our technique, will lead to creative solutions to challenging anatomical variation and overall improved patient care.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted surgery is becoming more widely applied in surgical subspecialties due to its intraoperative and postoperative advantages such as minimally invasive approach, reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and decreased incidence of postoperative complications. However, robotic devices were only recently introduced in the field of spinal surgery. Specifically, percutaneous approaches involving computer-assisted image guidance are relatively new in iliac screw fixation. Previous methods focused on the use of S2-alar-iliac (S2AI) screw fixation which allows for pelvic fixation without a need for side connectors. However, for patients with destructive lesions of the sacrum, placement of these S2AI screws may not be feasible. The purpose of this technical note is to illustrate the implementation of robotic-assisted percutaneous iliac screw fixation in two cases which allows for minimally invasive attachment to the proximal lumbar screws without a side connector and eliminates a potential source of instrumentation failure. METHODS: Robotic-assisted percutaneous iliac screw fixation was performed on two patients. The robotics system was used to merge the fluoroscopic images with intraoperative computed tomography (CT) images to plan the trajectories for placement of bilateral pedicle and iliac screws. Intraoperative CT scan was again performed to confirm proper placement of all screws. Rods were then engaged bilaterally with the pedicle and iliac screws without the use of side connectors. RESULTS: The patients did not experience immediate postoperative complications and had stable hardware at one-month follow-up. Our cases demonstrate the surgical efficiency of robotic-assisted lumbo-iliac instrumentation which obviates the need to use a side connector, which is commonly used in iliac fixation. This eliminates a step, which can reduce the possibility of instrumentation failure. CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted percutaneous iliac screw fixation is a safe and feasible technique to improve operative and clinical outcomes in complex spinal instrumentation surgeries.",

                  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Primary spine tumors are rare neoplasms that affect about 0.62 per 100,000 individuals in the US. Intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCTs) are the rarest of all primary tumors involving the spine and can cause pain, imbalance, urinary dysfunction and neurological deficits. These types of tumors oftentimes necessitate surgical treatment, yet there is a lack of data on hospital length of stay and complication rates following treatment. Given that treatment candidacy, quality of life, and outcomes are tied so closely to potential for prolonged length of stay and postoperative complications, it is important to better understand the factors that increase the risk of these outcomes in patients with IMSCTs. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for all patients undergoing surgery for treatment of intramedullary spinal cord tumors between 2005 and 2017. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess patient risk factors influencing prolonged length of stay and post-op complications. RESULTS: A total of 638 patients were included in the analysis. Pre-operative American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status classification of 3 and above (OR 1.89; p = 0.0005), dependent functional status (OR 2.76; p = 0.0035) and transfer from facilities other than home (OR 8.12; p <0.0001) were independent predictors of prolonged length of stay (>5 days). The most commonly reported complications were pneumonia (5.7%), urinary tract infection (9.4%), septic shock (3.8%), superficial incisional infection (5.7%), organ or space infection (5.7%), pulmonary embolism (11.3%), DVT requiring therapy (15.1%) and wound dehiscence (5.7%). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the significant influence of clinical variables on prolonged hospitalization of IMSCT patients.

One drawback has been the increased reliance on fluoroscopy and subsequent exposure to ionizing radiation. We have previously shown the efficacy of a novel instrument tracking system in cadaveric and preliminary clinical studies for commonplace orthopedic and spine procedures. In the present study, we examined the radiation and operative time using a novel instrument tracking system compared with standard C-arm fluoroscopy for patients undergoing minimally invasive lumbar fusion. METHODS: The radiation emitted, number of radiographs taken, and time required to complete 2 tasks were recorded between the instrument tracking systems and conventional C-arm fluoroscopy. The studied tasks included placement of the initial dilator through Kambin's triangle during percutaneous lumbar interbody fusion and placement of pedicle screws during both percutaneous lumbar interbody fusion and minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with or without instrument tracking. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients were included in the analysis encompassing 31 total levels. For the task of placing the initial dilator into Kambin's triangle, an average of 4.21 minutes (2.4 vs. 6.6 minutes; P = 0.002), 15 fluoroscopic images (5.4 vs. 20.5; P = 0.002), and 8.14 mGy (3.3 vs. 11.4; P = 0.011) were saved by instrument tracking. For pedicle screw insertion, an average of 5.69 minutes (3.97 vs. 9.67; P < 0.001), 14 radiographs (6.53 vs. 20.62; P < 0.001), and 7.89 mGy (2.98 vs. 10.87 mGy; P < 0.001) were saved per screw insertion.

This study aimed to assess the incidence of surgically significant ASD in adult patients who have undergone index LLIF and to identify any predictive factors. METHODS: Patients who underwent index LLIF with or without additional posterior pedicle screw fixation between 2010 and 2012 and received a minimum of 2 years of postoperative follow-up were retrospectively included. Demographic and perioperative data were recorded, as well as radiographic data and immediate perioperative complications. The primary endpoint was revision surgery at the level above or below the previous construct, from which a survivorship model of patients with surgically significant symptomatic ASD was created. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with a total of 163 interbody levels were included in this analysis. In total, 17 (25.4%) patients developed surgically significant ASD and required additional surgery, with a mean ± SD time to revision of 3.59 ± 2.55 years. The mean annual rate of surgically significant ASD was 3.49% over 7.27 years, which was the average follow-up. One-third of patients developed significant disease within 2 years of index surgery, and 1 patient required surgery at the adjacent level within 1 year. Constructs spanning 3 or fewer interbody levels were significantly associated with increased risk of surgically significant ASD; however, instrument termination at the thoracolumbar junction did not increase this risk. Surgically significant ASD was not impacted by preoperative disc height, foraminal area at the adjacent levels, or changes in global or segmental lumbar lordosis. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of surgically significant ASD after LLIF was similar to the previously reported rates of other minimally invasive spine procedures. Patients with shorter constructs had higher rates of subsequent ASD.",

                  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Instrument-navigation modalities including CT-guided and robot-assisted methods claim both efficacy and accuracy when applied to spine surgery, yet often increase setup and operating times which can translate to increased costs. To see the impact of different technologies on surgical efficiency, we studied the impact of a single surgeon's experience with a multitude of instrument navigational technologies. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) were analyzed. Consecutive cases were done with assistance of a robot (Mazor, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), with the assistance of fluoroscopic instrument-tracking (TrackX, North Carolina, USA), or fluoroscopy alone without adjunctive navigation in consecutive blocks of time. The cases done without assistance were used to normalize for number of interbody implants and decompressions performed as well as hardware removal if needed. Age, body mass index (BMI), sex, operative levels, laminectomy, need for hardware removal, and total operative time were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 119 cases (74 conventional, 13 robot-assisted, 32 instrument-tracking) were included in analysis. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or BMI between modalities. Average total operative time for robot-assisted, and instrument-tracking-assisted cases was 175.46 ± 46.86 min 119.63 ± 34.33 min, respectively, for each level (p < 0.05 across each group). After normalization against operative times from similar cases performed with conventional fluoroscopy, robotic-navigation added an average of 42.25 ± 28.35 min while use of instrument-tracking saved an average of 13.88 ± 38.69 min. There was no learning curve seen using robotic navigation, as operative times remained consistently longer than similar cases using conventional fluoroscopy and showed no sign of improvement over time. Cases using instrument-tracking were initially slower but trended downwards through approximately 11 patients, at which point operative times were consistently quicker (R2 = 0.39). None of the assisted cases were abandoned in favor of standard fluoroscopy or required hardware revision. CONCLUSION: Enabling technology can have a significant impact on surgical efficiency. Compared to MIS-TLIFs performed with standard fluoroscopy, those done with robotic-assistance consistently negatively impacted operative times while instrument-tracking was associated with a short learning curve and in the majority of cases studied showed improved operative times.",

                  "abstract": "Spinal fusion has undergone significant evolution and improvement over the past 50 yr. Historically, spine fusion was noninstrumented and arthrodesis was based entirely on autograft. Improved understanding of spinal anatomy and materials science ushered in a new era of spinal fusion equipped with screw-based technologies and various interbody devices. Osteobiologics is another important realm of spine fusion, and the evolution of various osteobiologics has perhaps undergone the most change within the past 20 yr. A new element to spinal instrumentation has recently gained traction-namely, surface technology. New data suggest that surface treatments play an increasingly well-recognized role in inducing osteogenesis and successful fusion. Until now, however, there has yet to be a unified resource summarizing the existing data and a lack of consensus exists on superior technology. Here, authors provide an in-depth review on surface technology and its impact on spinal arthrodesis.",

Outcomes are determined by severity of immediate injury, mitigation of secondary downstream effects, and rehabilitation. This study aimed to understand how the center type a patient presents to and whether they are transferred influence management and outcome. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was used to identify patients with SCI. The primary objective was to determine association between center type, transfer, and surgical intervention. A secondary objective was to determine association between center type, transfer, and surgical timing. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit on surgical intervention and timing of the surgery as binary variables, adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic variables. RESULTS: There were 11,744 incidents of SCI identified. A total of 2,883 patients were transferred to a Level I center and 4,766 presented directly to a level I center. Level I center refers to level I trauma center. Those who were admitted directly to level I centers had a higher odd of receiving a surgery (odds ratio, 1.703; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-1.97; p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in terms of timing of surgery. Patients transferred into a level I center were also more likely to undergo surgery than those at a level II/III/IV center, although this was not significant (odds ratio, 1.213; 95% confidence interval, 0.099-1.48; p = 0.059). CONCLUSION: Patients with traumatic SCI admitted to level I trauma centers were more likely to have surgery, particularly if they were directly admitted to a level I center. This study provides insights into a large US sample and sheds light on opportunities for improving pre hospital care pathways for patients with traumatic SCI, to provide the timely and appropriate care and achieve the best possible outcomes.

The authors performed a retrospective, multi-institutional study to investigate the clinical and radiographic characteristics of patients undergoing single-level anterior cervical discectomy with fusion performed using the osteobiologic agent Osteocel, an allograft mesenchymal stem cell matrix. METHODS: The medical records across 3 medical centers and 12 spine surgeons were retrospectively queried for patients undergoing single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with the use of Osteocel. Pseudarthrosis was determined based on CT or radiographic imaging of the cervical spine. Patients were determined to have radiographic pseudarthrosis if they met any of the following criteria: 1) lack of bridging bone on CT obtained > 300 days postoperatively, 2) evidence of instrumentation failure, or 3) motion across the index level as seen on flexion-extension cervical spine radiographs. Univariate and multivariate analyses were then performed to identify independent preoperative or perioperative predictors of pseudarthrosis in this population. RESULTS: A total of 326 patients met the inclusion criteria; 43 (13.2%) patients met criteria for pseudarthrosis, of whom 15 (34.9%) underwent revision surgery. There were no significant differences between patients with and those without pseudarthrosis, respectively, for patient age (54.1 vs 53.8 years), sex (34.9% vs 47.4% male), race, prior cervical spine surgery (37.2% vs 33.6%), tobacco abuse (16.3% vs 14.5%), chronic kidney disease (2.3% vs 2.8%), and diabetes (18.6% vs 14.5%) (p > 0.05). Presence of osteopenia or osteoporosis (16.3% vs 3.5%) was associated with pseudarthrosis (p < 0.001). Implant type was also significantly associated with pseudarthrosis, with a 16.4% rate of pseudarthrosis for patients with polyetherethereketone (PEEK) implants versus 8.4% for patients with allograft implants (p = 0.04). Average lengths of follow-up were 27.6 and 23.8 months for patients with and those without pseudarthrosis, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated osteopenia or osteoporosis (OR 4.97, 95% CI 1.51-16.4, p < 0.01) and usage of PEEK implant (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.04-4.83, p = 0.04) as independent predictors of pseudarthrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who underwent single-level ACDF, rates of pseudarthrosis associated with the use of the osteobiologic agent Osteocel are higher than the literature-reported rates associated with the use of alternative osteobiologics. This is especially true when Osteocel is combined with a PEEK implant.",

While the association of clinical outcomes and transfer status has been examined in other specialties, the relationship between transfer status, complications, and risk of mortality in patients with MSD has yet to be explored. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of transfer status on in-hospital mortality and clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with MSD. METHODS: The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was retrospectively queried for adult patients diagnosed with vertebral pathological fracture and/or spinal cord compression in the setting of metastatic disease between 2012 and 2014. Demographics, baseline characteristics (e.g., metastatic spinal cord compression [MSCC] and paralysis), comorbidities, type of intervention, and relevant patient outcomes were controlled in a multivariable logistic regression model to analyze the association of transfer status with patient outcomes. RESULTS: Within the 10,360 patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, higher rates of MSCC (50.2% vs 35.9%, p < 0.001) and paralysis (17.3% vs 8.4%, p < 0.001) were observed in patients transferred between hospitals compared to those directly admitted. In univariable analysis, a higher percentage of transferred patients underwent surgical intervention (p < 0.001) when compared with directly admitted patients. After controlling for significant covariates and surgical intervention, transferred patients were more likely to develop in-hospital complications (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18-1.52, p < 0.001), experience prolonged length of stay (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.16-1.52, p < 0.001), and have a discharge disposition other than home (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.46-1.98, p < 0.001), with no significant difference in inpatient mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MSD who were transferred between hospitals demonstrated more severe clinical presentations and higher rates of inpatient complications compared to directly admitted patients, despite demonstrating no difference in in-hospital mortality rates.",

The use of CT-based image guidance has been shown to increase the accuracy in instrumentation placement and to reduce the rate of reoperation. However, incidental findings that are obvious in retrospect are still missed in spinal fusion surgeries due to the concept of inattentional blindness and surgeons' preoccupation with the main objective of intraoperative CT (i.e. instrumentation accuracy). CASE DESCRIPTION: The first case describes a 60-year-old male who underwent posterior spinal laminectomy and interbody fusions from L2-L5. Intraoperative CT confirmed appropriate placement of hardware. However, when he was transferred out to the care unit and extubated, he developed a severe headache for which the source was confirmed to be a pneumocephalus from durotomy and cerebrospinal fluid leakage on repeat CT. A retrospective review of his intraoperative CT demonstrated the intrathecal air at L5-S1 interlaminar space that was missed on evaluation during surgery. The second case describes a 68-year-old female who was treated with a successful T4 to pelvis instrumentation and fusion with vertebral column resection at T10 confirmed with imaging. Postoperatively, she developed rapidly progressive oxygen desaturation and was found to have a pneumothorax which had been present on the intraoperative imaging. CONCLUSION: This case report of two patients with missed intraoperative findings demonstrates the importance of looking beyond instrumentation placement and evaluating the entire intraoperative CT imaging to find abnormalities that could complicate the patients' postoperative recovery and overall hospital stay.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers efficient, noninvasive treatment of spinal neoplasms. Single-fraction (SF) high-dose SBRT has a relatively narrow therapeutic window, while hypofractionated delivery of SBRT may have an improved safety profile with similar efficacy. Because the optimal approach of delivery is unknown, the authors examined whether hypofractionated SBRT improves pain and/or functional outcomes and results in better tumor control compared with SF-SBRT. METHODS: This is a single-institution retrospective study of adult patients with spinal metastases treated with SF- or three-fraction (3F) SBRT from 2008 to 2019. Demographics and baseline characteristics, radiographic data, and posttreatment outcomes at a minimum follow-up of 3 months are reported. RESULTS: Of the 156 patients included in the study, 70 (44.9%) underwent SF-SBRT (median total dose 1700 cGy) and 86 (55.1%) underwent 3F-SBRT (median total dose 2100 cGy). At baseline, a higher proportion of patients in the 3F-SBRT group had a worse baseline profile, including severity of pain (p < 0.05), average use of pain medication (p < 0.001), and functional scores (p < 0.05) compared with the SF-SBRT cohort. At the 3-month follow-up, the 3F-SBRT cohort experienced a greater frequency of improvement in pain compared with the SF-SBRT group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, patients treated with 3F-SBRT demonstrated a higher frequency of improved Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores (p < 0.05) compared with those treated with SF-SBRT, with no significant difference in the frequency of improvement in modified Rankin Scale scores. Local tumor control did not differ significantly between the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received spinal 3F-SBRT more frequently achieved significant pain relief and an increased frequency of improvement in KPS compared with those treated with SF-SBRT. Local tumor control was similar in the two groups. Future work is needed to establish the relationship between fractionation schedule and clinical outcomes.",

METHODS: Patient data were collected from the United States National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from the years 2012-2014. Descriptive statistics were used to compare data from 51,800 cases; subsequently, multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the effect of gender on outcomes. RESULTS: Males had significantly higher rates of in-hospital mortality (OR 1.30; 95 % CI 1.09-1.56, p = 0.004) and were more likely to have received surgical intervention than females (OR 1.34; 95 % CI 1.16-1.55, p < 0.001). Additionally, female patients were more likely to present with vertebral compression fracture (p < 0.001), while metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) and paralysis were more common in male patients (p < 0.001).

The treatment of preoperative anemia is based on guidelines made by the American College of Cardiology (ACC), which recommends packed red blood cell transfusion when hematocrit is less than 21% in patients without cardiovascular disease and 24% in patients with cardiovascular disease. The literature has yet to quantify the risk profile associated with preoperative pRBC transfusion. PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of complications following preoperative pRBC transfusion in a cohort of patients undergoing spine surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of a national surgical database. PATIENT SAMPLE: The national surgical quality improvement program database OUTCOME NEASURES: Postoperative physiologic complications after a preoperative transfusion. Complications were defined as the occurrence of any DVT, PE, stroke, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, longer length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation greater than 48 h, surgical site infections, sepsis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, or higher 30-day mortality. METHODS: The national surgical quality improvement program database was queried, and patients were included if they had any type of spine surgery and had a preoperative transfusion. RESULTS: Preoperative pRBC transfusion was found to be protective against complications when the hematocrit was less than 20% and associated with more complications when the hematocrit was higher than 20%. In patients with a hematocrit higher than 20%, pRBC transfusion was associated with longer lengths of stay, and higher rates of ventilator dependency greater than 48 h, pneumonia, and 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to identify an inflection point in determining when a preoperative pRBC transfusion may be protective or may contribute to complications. Further studies are needed to be conducted to stratify by the prevalence of cardiovascular disease.",

OBJECTIVES: It has been reported that 2.4-3.7% of all blunt trauma victims suffer some element of cervical spine fracture, with the majority of these patients suffering from C3-7 (subaxial) involvement. With the improvement of first-response to trauma in the community, there are an increasing number of patients who survive their initial trauma and thus arrive at the hospital in need of further evaluation, stabilization, and management of these injuries. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review compiled all relevant data on the biomechanics, imaging, evaluation, and medical and surgical management strategies for subaxial cervical spine fractures. RESULTS: After review of the current literature on subaxial cervical spine biomechanics, imaging characteristics, evaluation strategies and surgical and orthopedic management techniques, the authors created a comprehensive review and protocol for management of subaxial cervical spine fractures. CONCLUSIONS: The subaxial cervical spine is biomechanically and anatomically unique from the remainder of the spinal axis. Evaluation of subaxial cervical spine injuries is nuanced, and improper management of these injuries can lead to significant patient morbidity and even death. This provides a comprehensive review combining anatomy, imaging characteristics, evaluation strategies, and surgical and orthopedic management principles for subaxial cervical spine fractures.",

This mechanism requires parents to choose schools based on causal effectiveness rather than peer characteristics. We study relationships among parent preferences, peer quality, and causal effects on outcomes for applicants to New York City’s centralized high school assignment mechanism. We use applicants’ rank-ordered choice lists to measure preferences and to construct selection-corrected estimates of treatment effects on test scores, high school graduation, college attendance, and college quality. Parents prefer schools that enroll high-achieving peers, and these schools generate larger improvements in short- and long-run student outcomes. Preferences are unrelated to school effectiveness and academic match quality after controlling for peer quality.",

Many of these assignment schemes use lotteries to ration seats when schools are oversubscribed. The resulting random assignment opens the door to credible quasi-experimental research designs for the evaluation of school effectiveness. Yet the question of how best to separate the lottery-generated randomization integral to such designs from non-random preferences and priorities remains open. This paper develops easily-implemented empirical strategies that fully exploit the random assignment embedded in a wide class of mechanisms, while also revealing why seats are randomized at one school but not another. We use these methods to evaluate charter schools in Denver, one of a growing number of districts that combine charter and traditional public schools in a unified assignment system. The resulting estimates show large achievement gains from charter school attendance. Our approach generates efficiency gains over ad hoc methods, such as those that focus on schools ranked first, while also identifying a more representative average causal effect. We also show how to use centralized assignment mechanisms to identify causal effects in models with multiple school sectors.",

It is difficult to know whether Gale and Shapley expected the literature they initiated to be used to improve the lives of masses of people all around the world. We are fortunate to see that this is happening today. The model that Gale and Shapley presented is very simple. A number of boys and girls have preferences for one another and would like to be matched. The question Gale and Shapley were interested in especially was whether there is a “stable” way to match each boy with a girl so that no unmatched pair can find out later that they can both do better by matching each other. Gale and Shapley found that indeed there is such a stable matching, and they presented a deferred-acceptance algorithm that achieves this objective. Versions of the algorithm are used today to match hospitals with medical residents and students with public schools in New York City and Boston. In 1974, Lloyd Shapley and Herbert Scarf published a related paper, “On Cores and Indivisibility,” in the first issue of the Journal of Mathematical Economics. Arguably, their model was the simplest exchange economy we could imagine. Each agent comes to the market with one indivisible good and seeks to trade it for more preferred goods that might be brought by other agents.",

The paper introduces student types and captures colleges' preferences for affirmative action via type-specific quotas: A college always prefers a set of students that respects its type-specific quotas to another set that violates them. Then it shows that the student-applying deferred acceptance mechanism makes truthful revelation of preferences a dominant strategy for every student if each college's preferences satisfy responsiveness over acceptable sets of students that respect its type-specific quotas. These results have direct policy implications in several entry-level labor markets (Roth 1991). Furthermore, a fairness notion and the related incentive theory developed here is applied to controlled choice in the context of public school choice by Abdulkadiroǧ lu and Sönmez (2003). © Springer-Verlag 2005.",

Since obtaining preferences over lotteries is often difficult, real-life mechanisms usually rely on ordinal preferences over deterministic outcomes. Bogomolnaia and Moulin (J. Econom. Theory 19 (2002) 623) show that the outcome of an ex post efficient mechanism may be stochastically dominated. They define a random assignment to be ordinally efficient if and only if it is not stochastically dominated. In this paper we investigate the relation between ex post efficiency and ordinal efficiency. We introduce a new notion of domination defined over sets of assignments and show that a lottery induces an ordinally efficient random assignment if and only if each subset of the full support of the lottery is undominated. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We then show that, within this repeated-interaction story, there is a big difference between communicative and tacit collusion.

This practice discourages existing tenants from such attempts and results in loss of potentially large gains from trade. Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple mechanism that is Pareto efficient, individually rational, and strategy-proof. Our approach is constructive and we provide two algorithms, each of which can be used to find the outcome of this mechanism. One additional merit of this mechanism is that it can accommodate any hierarchy of seniorities. Journal of Economic Literature Classification Numbers: C71, C78, D71, DF8. © 1999 Academic Press.",

This paper presents the empirical case against the previous Boston \nmechanism, a priority matching mechanism, and the case in favor of the change to a \nstrategy-proof mechanism. Using detailed records on student choices and assignments, \nwe present evidence both of sophisticated strategic behavior among some parents, and \nof unsophisticated strategic behavior by others. We find evidence that some parents pay \nclose attention to the capacity constraints of different schools, while others appear not \nto. In particular, we show that many unassigned students could have been assigned to \none of their stated choices with a different strategy under the current mechanism. This \ninteraction between sophisticated and unsophisticated players identifies a new rationale \nfor strategy-proof mechanisms based on fairness, and was a critical argument in Boston's \ndecision to change the mechanism. We then discuss the considerations that led to the \nadoption of a deferred acceptance mechanism as opposed to the (also strategy-proof) top \ntrading cycles mechanism.",

                  "abstract": "For many years scholars have recognized that late nineteenth-century Durham, North Carolina makes an ideal case study for examining emancipation, industrialization, immigration, and urbanization in the context of the New South. \"With its tobacco factories, textile mills, black entrepreneurs, and new college,\" the historian Syd Nathans observes, \"Durham was a hub of enterprise and hope.\" By the early twentieth century, Durham became renowned for its vibrant entrepreneurial spirit. Both W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington wrote articles for the national press about their visits with members of Durham's African-American community. After his visit in 1910, Booker T. Washington dubbed Durham the \"City of Negro Enterprises.\"\n\nThe Digital Durham website offers students, teachers, and researchers a range of primary sources with which they can investigate the economic, social, cultural, and political history of a post-bellum southern community. Letters from mothers to daughters, parents to children, and husbands and wives give insight into the domestic lives of some of Durham's elite citizens.   Entries from Atlas Rigsbee's general store ledger together with data from the 1880 census provide a view into the social experience of those Durham citizens who have not left written documents. Taken together the new materials on Digital Durham touch on over 600 topics including African American business enterprise, the emergence of textiles, tobacco production and marketing, child labor, prohibition, evangelical revivalism, nineteenth-century medical practices, women's experience of childbirth, and public and private education.\n\nThe holdings of the website provide access to a wide range of manuscript and printed materials from the 1870s through the 1920s. The site also features a new collection of maps that depict Durham from the late 1860s to the present day. Digital Durham offers its users a selection of manuscript letters taken from the Southgate-Jones family papers and James Southgate papers, accounts from Atlas M. Rigsbee's general store ledger, photographs, ephemera, census data, printed works as well as a rich collection of maps. The site also includes audio postcards created by Duke students in an undergraduate research seminar on the history of Durham and the New South. Additionally, the site includes resources for K-12 educators--a reference section with glossary of terms used in the 1880 census and lesson plans that tie to the North Carolina Standard Course of Study.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-term survival in penile cancer is dependent on the presence and extent of lymph node metastases. Historically, inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) has been performed via an open approach (O-ILND). More recently, minimally invasive surgical alternatives (MIS-ILND) such as video-endoscopic and robot-assisted ILND have emerged. This review aims to compare the (1) perioperative outcomes, (2) complication rates, and (3) oncological efficacy between O-ILND and MIS-ILND. METHODS: We conducted a PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis including studies comparing O-ILND versus MIS-ILND for penile cancer. Outcomes were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Sixteen articles comprising 1054 patients were analysed. There was an observed trend towards longer operative time for the MIS-ILND approach (mean difference 28 min; 95% CI -2 to 58 min, p = 0.06), particularly with the robotic-assisted technique. Total LN yield (mean 12.3, mean difference 0.3, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.9, p = 0.13), and positive LN (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88-1.10, p = 0.75) were similar between groups. MIS-ILND significantly reduced complication rates for both minor (RR: 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.94, p = 0.02) and major complications (RR: 0.25, 95% CI 0.12-0.53, p = 0.002). Particularly, there was also lower wound infection rate with MIS-ILND (RR: 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.82, p = 0.02), corresponding to a shorter hospital stay of average 4 days (MD -4, 95% CI -6--2, p = 0.05). Rates of skin/flap necrosis, lymphedema, lymphocele, and drainage time did not differ significantly. Local groin recurrence and overall survival did not differ between approaches. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-ILND is associated with fewer perioperative complications and shorter hospitalisation without compromising oncologic outcomes. These findings support its broader adoption, particularly in high-volume centres with appropriate surgical expertise.",

                  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Metachronous bladder recurrences after prior treatment for primary upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) can occur in ∼3% to 50% of patients. Because UTUC demonstrated distinct molecular alterations, bladder recurrences in these patients may be molecularly and phenotypically different compared to primary bladder carcinoma. We aim to study the BCG efficacy in patients with primary high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (P-NMIBC) and metachronous bladder recurrences after previous nephroureterectomy for UTUC (M-NMIBC). METHODS: We reviewed an IRB-approved prospective uro-oncology database of patients who underwent resection followed by BCG therapy for high grade NMIBC from 2017 to 2021. Clinicopathological parameters, intravesical therapies and the oncological outcomes were analyzed. Patients in the P-NMIBC group were matched to patients in the M-NMIBC cohort (control) via propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust for potential clinicopathological confounders. Nearest-neighbor PSM targeting a 4:1 ratio of study to control subjects was performed using a caliper of 0.2, aiming for an absolute standardized mean difference of <0.1 across key covariates. Secondary outcomes were progression to distant metastasis and overall survival. Logistic and cox regression analyses were performed to elucidate independent variables associated with intravesical recurrences and disease progression. RESULTS: Of the 183 patients diagnosed with NMIBC, 35 patients were identified to have a history of UTUC with radical nephroureterectomy. EAU risk stratification revealed 50 (27.3%) intermediate risk, 107 (58.5%) high risk and 26 (14.2%) very high risk groups. P-NMIBC patients were more likely to have symptomatic presentation (79.7% vs. 23.9%), and a larger mean tumor size (25.7 mm vs. 15.4 mm) than M-NMIBC. The mean follow-up duration for the study was 34.0 months. In the unmatched analysis, M-NMIBC was associated with increased risk of HG intravesical recurrence post BCG compared to P-NMIBC (54.3% vs. 28.4%, P = 0.006, HR 2.14, 95% CI: 1.25-3.65) and increased risk of progression to MIBC (28.6% vs. 4.7%, P = 0.007, HR 4.19, 95% CI: 1.47-11.95). For the propensity-matched analysis, the control group consisted of 35 M-NMIBC matched to 123 P-NMIBC patients for similar demographics, EAU risk score and BCG doses. M-NMIBC again demonstrated a higher HG intravesical recurrence rate (54.3% vs. 22.8%, P = 0.001, HR 2.67, 95% CI: 1.50-4.77), progression to MIBC (28.6% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.022, HR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.20-9.75) and progression to distant metastasis (20.0% vs. 6.5%, P = 0.033, HR 3.02, 95% CI: 1.09-8.35). Overall survival in both groups were not significantly different in both unmatched and matched analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that BCG treatment may be less effective for NMIBC patients with a history of UTUC, with a higher risk of intravesical recurrences and disease progression. This is an important consideration when counselling patients for BCG treatment and overall prognostication.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: SEPTA was a multicenter trial validating Stockholm3 in a racially/ethnically diverse population of men meeting local care guidelines for prostate biopsy (2019-2023). In total, 2115 (98%) men with complete data for risk calculators and biomarkers were included. The primary outcome was detection of Grade Group ≥ 2 (GG ≥ 2) cancer. Predictors included Stockholm3, free/total PSA ratio, PSA density, European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer-4, Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group, and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial version 2 risk calculators. Performance characteristics were computed at clinically used thresholds for each risk score. ROC analysis, graphical calibration assessment, and decision curve analysis were performed. RESULTS: Among 2115 men, median age was 63 years (IQR: 58-68), median PSA was 6.1 ng/mL (IQR: 4.5-9.0), 415 (20%) had a prior negative prostate biopsy, and 356 (17%) had an MRI performed before biopsy. There were 1200 (56.7%) benign biopsies performed, 307 (14.5%) GG1 cancers detected, and 608 (28.8%) GG ≥ 2 cancers detected. The Stockholm3 test had superior discrimination (all P < .001) compared with all evaluated biomarkers and risk calculators with an AUC of 0.82 vs 0.72 for free/total PSA, 0.76 for PSA density, 0.77 for European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer-4, 0.74 for Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group, and 0.78 for Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial version 2. Decision curve analysis demonstrated superior performance of Stockholm3, showing the highest positive net benefit. Compared with free/total PSA, Stockholm3 could reduce unnecessary biopsies by 44% while maintaining a 0.95 sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Stockholm3 outperforms other commonly used biomarkers and risk calculators for detecting GG ≥ 2 cancer in a diverse population.",

Few novel prostate cancer biomarkers have been validated in diverse cohorts. We aimed to determine if Stockholm3 can improve prostate cancer detection in a diverse cohort. METHODS: An observational prospective multicentered (17 sites) clinical trial (2019-2023), supplemented by prospectively recruited participants (2008-2020) in a urology clinic setting included men with suspicion of PCa and underwent prostate biopsy. Before biopsy, sample was collected for measurement of the Stockholm3 risk score. Parameters include prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free PSA, KLK2, GDF15, PSP94, germline risk (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), age, family history, and previous negative biopsy. The primary endpoint was detection of International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade ≥2 cancer (clinically significant PCa, csPC). The two primary aims were to (1) demonstrate noninferior sensitivity (0.8 lower bound 95% CI noninferiority margin) in detecting csPC using Stockholm3 compared with PSA (relative sensitivity) and (2) demonstrate superior specificity by reducing biopsies with benign results or low-grade cancers (relative specificity). RESULTS: A total of 2,129 biopsied participants were included: Asian (16%, 350), Black or African American (Black; 24%, 505), Hispanic or Latino and White (Hispanic; 14%, 305), and non-Hispanic or non-Latino and White (White; 46%, 969). Overall, Stockholm3 showed noninferior sensitivity compared with PSA ≥4 ng/mL (relative sensitivity: 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92 to 0.99]) and nearly three times higher specificity (relative specificity: 2.91 [95% CI, 2.63 to 3.22]). Results were consistent across racial and ethnic subgroups: noninferior sensitivity (0.91-0.98) and superior specificity (2.51-4.70). Compared with PSA, Stockholm3 could reduce benign and ISUP 1 biopsies by 45% overall and between 42% and 52% across racial and ethnic subgroups. CONCLUSION: In a substantially diverse population, Stockholm3 significantly reduces unnecessary prostate biopsies while maintaining a similar sensitivity to PSA in detecting csPC.",

METHODS: All major databases were searched for articles published before May 2023 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The primary outcome was the accuracy of flexible BLC vs WLC in detecting bladder cancer recurrence among suspicious bladder lesions. RESULTS: A total of 10 articles, comprising 1634 patients, were deemed eligible for the quantitative synthesis. In the meta-analysis focusing on the detection of disease recurrence, there was no difference between flexible BLC and WLC (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.41)]; the risk difference (RD) showed 1% of flexible BLC, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 100. In the subgroup meta-analysis of detection of carcinoma in situ (CIS) only, there was again no significant difference between flexible BLC and WLC (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.82-1.69), BLC was associated with a RD of 2% (NNT = 50). The positive predictive values for flexible BLC and WLC in detecting all types of recurrence were 72% and 66%, respectively, and for CIS they were 39% and 29%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Surveillance of NMIBC with flexible BLC could detect more suspicious lesions and consequently more tumour recurrences compared to flexible WLC, with a increase in the rate of false positives leading to overtreatment. A total of 100 and 50 flexible BLC procedures would need to be performed to find on additional tumor and CIS recurences, respectively. A risk-stratified strategy for patient selection could be considered when using flexible BLC for the surveillance of NMIBC patients.",

The new single port (SP) system allows to work in every abdominal quadrant maintaining an adequate triangulation without the need for changes in the port positioning. METHODS: In February 2020, two patients underwent a robotic SP partial nephrectomy for malignancy combined with a cholecystectomy and a left inguinal hernia repair respectively. RESULTS: Both procedures were successfully completed with one robotic docking and without the need for conversion. The operative time was 213 minutes for the right partial nephrectomy (126 min) with cholecystectomy (18 min), and 257 minutes for the left partial nephrectomy (161 min) with inguinal hernia repair (35 min). Estimated blood loss was 200 (150-250) mL, while the total warm ischemia time was 15 minutes for the right partial nephrectomy and 53 minutes for the left partial nephrectomy. There were no intraoperative complications or perioperative transfusions. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the postoperative hospital stay was 1 and 2 days. Both resections had free margins and the median tumor size was 2.5 (1.5-3.5) cm. Histopathology analysis revealed chronic cholecystitis and renal cell carcinomas with free margins and a median tumor size of 2.5 (1.5-3.5) cm. After a mean follow-up of 24 months, no surgical-related complications or recurrence were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The robotic SP approach facilitates the completion of combined surgical procedures in multiple abdominal quadrants through a single 25mm incision.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively recruited 2 cohorts of men undergoing prostate biopsy from 5 facilities in Chicago. The first cohort was split into development (70%) and internal validation (30%) groups. The second was used for external validation. Iterative logistic regression was used to develop 3 models for predicting GG ≥ 2 PCa. Models were compared for discrimination using the C statistics, calibration curves, and net benefit curves. The frequency of unnecessary biopsies and missed PCas was compared at 10% and 30% risk thresholds. RESULTS: The 2 cohorts included 393 and 292 Black men, respectively. Our first model, Mistry-Sun 1, used serum PSA and prior negative biopsy. Mistry-Sun 2 added abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE) and an interaction term with abnormal DRE and PSA to Mistry-Sun 1. Mistry-Sun 3 added prostate volume, abnormal DRE, and age to Mistry-Sun 1. The C statistics were 0.74, 0.74, and 0.78, respectively, and were similar to or higher than established calculators. At the 10% and 30% risk thresholds our models had the fewest unnecessary biopsies and an appropriate proportion of missed GG ≥ 2 PCas. CONCLUSIONS: Tailoring a risk calculator to detect clinically significant PCa in Black men may improve biopsy decision-making and outcomes compared to tools developed in non-Black populations.",

This review will assess the current knowledge of castrate-sensitive OMPCa. METHODS: A review of the current literature was performed to summarize the definition and classification of OMPCa, assess the diagnostic methods and imaging modalities utilized, and to review the treatment options and outcomes. We further identify gaps in knowledge and areas for future research. RESULTS: Currently there is no unified definition of OMPCa. National guidelines mostly recommend systemic therapies without distinguishing oligometastatic and polymetastatic disease. Next generation imaging is more sensitive than conventional imaging and has led to early detection of metastases at initial diagnosis or recurrence. While mostly retrospective in nature, recent studies suggest that treatment (surgical or radiation) of the primary tumor and/or metastatic sites might delay initiation of androgen deprivation therapy while increasing survival in selected patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective data are required to better assess the incremental improvement in survival and quality of life achieved with various treatment strategies in patients with OMPCa.",

Secondarily, this study reports the accuracy of fractional order calculus (FROC) diffusion and quantitative T2 compared with the Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System (PI-RADS). METHODS: This prospective pilot study (NCT04175730) enrolled 50 prostate biopsy-naïve men who met eligibility criteria. All men received 3T MRI with T2 and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (b-values: 50-4,000 s/mm2). Men with PI-RADS lesions ≥3 underwent targeted and systematic prostate biopsy, omitting systematic biopsy cores in peripheral zone lesions. DWI series images were fit to signal decay to calculate ADC (mm2/s) and the FROC model for coefficient DF (mm2/s). The primary end point was detection of Gleason grade group ≥2 (GG≥2) PCa. Receiver operating characteristic regression and area under the curve (AUC) were reported. RESULTS: Forty-eight men underwent MRI and biopsy. Mean age was 61.5 years (56-68), 29% were White, 52% were African American, mean PSA was 6.0 ng/mL (4.9-8.0), and mean PSA density was 0.14 ng/mL2. In total, 61 PI-RADS ≥3 lesions were targeted for biopsy. GG≥2 PC was found in 7% (1/14) of PI-RADS 3 lesions, 28% (10/36) of PI-RADS 4 lesions, and 36% (4/11) of PI-RADS 5 lesions. The AUC for detection of GG≥2 PC was 0.63 (0.5-0.76) for PI-RADS, 0.82 (0.68-0.96) for ADC, and 0.87 (0.77-0.97) for the FROC model. CONCLUSION: This small prospective pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel quantitative biparametic MRI protocol to detect prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve men.",

Despite improvement in multimodal strategies and technology, mortality is still high and literature is limited about perioperative outcomes comparison to other radical procedures. METHODS: We analyzed National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) baseline database of all male patients undergoing cystectomy, low anterior resection/abdominoperineal resection (LAR/APR) or TPE from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2016. Postoperative complications within 30 days after surgery were measured including: Wound infection, septic complications, deep vein thrombosis, cardiovascular events, and return to the operating room or mortality, etc. Differences between groups were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. RESULTS: A total of 7,375 patients underwent radical cystectomy, 49,762 underwent LAR/APR and 792 underwent TPE. Cystectomy patients were on average older compared to TPE or LAR/APR patients (P<0.001). In univariable and multivariable analysis, patients undergoing TPE had greater infectious and septic complications compared to cystectomy (odds ratio =1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.12) and LAR/APR (odds ratio =1.08; 95% CI: 1.05-1.11). Moreover, TPE had a slightly higher mortality within the 30-day postoperatively than those who underwent LAR/APR (odds ratio =1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02) and cystectomy (odds ratio =1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.01). CONCLUSIONS: Men undergoing TPE had greater rates of infections and postoperative complications compared to those undergoing radical cystectomy and LAR/APR. From a clinical standpoint, TPE has high morbidity that could provide opportunity for quality improvement projects with the goal of mitigating high complication rates.",

                  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Oncotype Dx Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) is a 17-gene relative expression assay that predicts adverse pathology at prostatectomy. We conducted a novel randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of GPS on urologist's treatment preference for favorable risk prostate cancer (PCa): active surveillance versus active treatment (i.e., prostatectomy/radiation). This is a secondary endpoint from the ENACT trial which recruited from three Chicago hospitals from 2016 to 2019. METHODS: Ten urologists along with men with very low to favorable-intermediate risk PCa were included in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to standardized counseling with or without GPS assay. The main outcome was urologists' preference for active treatment at Visit 2 by study arm (GPS versus Control). Multivariable best-fit binary logistic regressions were constructed to identify factors independently associated with urologists' treatment preference. RESULTS: Two hundred men (70% Black) were randomly assigned to either the Control (96) or GPS arm (104). At Visit 2, urologists' preference for prostatectomy/radiation almost doubled in the GPS arm to 29.3% (29) compared to 14.1% (13) in the Control arm (p = 0.01). Randomization to the GPS arm, intermediate NCCN risk level, and lower patient health literacy were predictors for urologists' preference for active treatment. DISCUSSION: Limitations included sample size and number of urologists. In this study, we found that GPS testing reduced urologists' likelihood to prefer active surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate how obtaining prognostic biomarkers that predict negative outcomes before treatment decision-making might influence urologists' preference for recommending aggressive therapy in men eligible for active surveillance.",

We sought to compare the incidence and factors associated with development of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) between RNU and NSS and examine the role of acute kidney injury (AKI) on renal function outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed an institutional database for patients who underwent either RNU or NSS for UTUC. Cumulative incidence of postoperative advanced CKD, defined as eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2, was compared between groups. Fine-Gray competing risk regression was used to identify predictors of advanced CKD. Locally weight scatterplot smoothing was used to assess postoperative eGFR trends. AKI events were counted, staged, and assessed for influence of progression to advanced CKD. RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-six patients were included in analysis, with a median follow up of 6.68 years (IQR 3.4-12.2). Median preoperative eGFR was similar between the groups (NSS: 68 ml/min/1.73 m2, RNU: 65 ml/min/1.73 m2,P = 0.220). Cumulative incidence of advanced CKD was significantly lower in the NSS cohort (P = 0.009). Factors associated with advanced CKD included age, diabetes, recurrent AKI and RNU. Percent of patients with an AKI event differed between the groups (51.5% NSS, 72.7% RNU, P = <0.001), there was no between group difference in percentage of patients with recurrent AKI (25.6% NSS, 25.9% RNU, P =1). CONCLUSION: NSS provides a renal function benefit in UTUC. AKI is common among UTUC patients and recurrent AKI is a risk factor for development of advanced CKD.",

Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent SP-RAPN or MP-RAPN at our institution between November 1, 2013 and May 30, 2021 was performed. Surgical platforms were compared through univariate analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables. Results: A total of 20 SP-RAPN and 42 MP-RAPN were performed utilizing a retroperitoneal approach. Patients who underwent SP-RAPN were more likely to have a lower radius, endophytic/exophytic, nearness, anterior/posterior, location score (4 vs 6; p = 0.0084) and their masses tended to be more exophytic, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.0535). Patients undergoing SP-RAPN had a shorter postoperative length of hospital stay (1 vs 2 days; p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, ischemia time, positive margin rate, malignant histology, postoperative complication rate, or Clavien-Dindo complication grade. Conclusion: Retroperitoneal SP-RAPN appear to be safe without compromising perioperative outcomes when compared with MP-RAPN for low-complexity renal masses. Further studies are recommended to assess the role of the SP for higher-complexity renal masses and to characterize variables that influence the observed difference in length of hospital stay.",

RESULTS: Mexicans had overall worse disease at presentation including highest median PSA (7.8 ng/mL), most prevalent T3/T4 stage (6.7%), M1 stage (8.9%), and high-grade Gleason scores (24.0%) when compared to all other Hispanic American groups. Cubans were most likely to receive hormone therapy and radiation therapy and least likely to receive surgical treatment. Compared to Mexicans, Cubans (hazards ratio [HR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval = [1.16-1.44]) had worse overall survival, while Puerto Ricans (HR = 1.08 [0.95-1.19] had similar overall survival, and Dominicans (HR = 0.63 [0 0.53-0.75]), South/Central Americans (HR = 0.75, [0.66-0.84]) and not specified (HR = 0.84 [0.79-0.91]) had better survival. CONCLUSION: Among Hispanic Americans with different countries of origin, disparities in prostate cancer characteristics, treatment choice, and survival do exist. Mexicans had the least favorable prostate cancer characteristics at presentation. Cubans had the worst overall survival while they were also most likely to receive hormone and/or radiation as first-line treatment. Our analysis demonstrates significant heterogeneity in the Hispanic American population.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of robotic-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RAPN) performed using the da Vinci Single-Port (SP) platform. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted from December 2018 to December 2019 of 14 consecutive patients with localized renal cancer who underwent SP robot-assisted partial nephrectomy at a single institution. The procedures were performed by 2 experienced robotic surgeons, reproducing the steps of the standard multiport robotic approach to partial nephrectomy. A transperitoneal approach was utilized with a 2.5 cm para-rectus incision with one assistant 12 mm laparoscopic port. RESULTS: No conversions to open or laparoscopic surgery occurred and no additional laparoscopic assistant ports were required. The median total operative time was 202 (162-231) minutes and the median total room time was 258 (215-295) minutes. The warm ischemia time averaged 20±8 minutes. 2 patients required angioembolization due to postoperative acute bleeding (Clavien-Dindo Grade 3a complication). Trifecta outcome (<25 min warm ischemia, no perioperative complications and negative margins) was achieved in 79% of patients. In one case, a positive margin was present. The median length of stay was of 1 day (Interquartile Range 1-2) with a median pain score on post-operative day 1 of 3.5 (Interquartile Range 2.4-5); 1/14 (7%) patient needed narcotic use at one week from discharge. At a median follow up of 5.0 (4.0-8.0) months, no patients have had evidence of disease recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: In this initial cohort, considering the introduction of a new technology, we observed satisfactory outcomes for several key perioperative variables including operative time, warm ischemia time, surgical margins, hospital stay, pain requirements in patients undergoing RAPN with the SP platform. For experienced robotic surgeons, RAPN with the SP platform is a safe and feasible approach for single site partial nephrectomy.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To quantify the heterogeneity of viscoelastic tissue properties in prostatectomy specimens from men with prostate cancer (PC) using MR elastography (MRE) with histopathology as reference. METHODS: Twelve fresh prostatectomy specimens were examined in a preclinical 9.4T MRI scanner. Maps of the complex shear modulus (|G*| in kPa) with its real and imaginary part (G' and G\" in kPa) were calculated at 500 Hz. Prostates were divided into 12 segments for segment-wise measurement of viscoelastic properties and histopathology. Coefficients of variation (CVs in %) were calculated for quantification of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Group-averaged values of cancerous vs. benign segments were significantly increased: |G*| of 12.13 kPa vs. 6.14 kPa, G' of 10.84 kPa vs. 5.44 kPa and G\" of 5.45 kPa vs. 2.92 kPa, all p < 0.001. In contrast, CVs were significantly increased for benign segments: 23.59% vs. 26.32% (p = 0.014) for |G*|, 27.05% vs. 37.84% (p < 0.003) for G', and 36.51% vs. 50.37% (p = 0.008) for G\". DISCUSSION: PC is characterized by a stiff yet homogeneous biomechanical signature, which may be due to the unique nondestructive growth pattern of PC with intervening stroma, providing a rigid scaffold in the affected area. In turn, increased heterogeneity in benign prostate segments may be attributable to the presence of different prostate zones with involvement by specific nonmalignant pathology.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies evaluated prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes in Black men on active surveillance (AS); most studies contained few Black men and results were conflicting. We performed a systematic review and meta-analyze of race and outcomes on AS. METHODS: A systematic search was performed for articles of men with Grade Group 1 or 2 (GG1 or GG2) PCa on AS. All studies required race-specific comparative progression data. Progression to treatment, PSA, or biopsy progression were considered and relative risk (RR) estimates of Black men progressing were extracted and pooled using random-effects models. Differences by study-level characteristics were evaluated using subgroup and a cumulative meta-analysis by time. RESULTS: In total, 12 studies were included (3137 Black and 12,206 non-Black men); eight prospective (27%, n = 4210) and four retrospectives (73%, n = 11,133) cohorts. The overall RR of progression for Black men was 1.62 (95%CI, 1.21-2.17), I2 = 64% (95% CI, 32-80%), (χ2 = 30.23; P = 0.001; τ2 = 0.16). Black men with GG1 PCa alone had a higher pooled progression: RR = 1.81 (95% CI, 1.23-2.68). Including only studies with clinical progression (excluding progression to treatment), potentiated results: RR = 1.82 (95%CI, 1.27-2.60). However, a cumulative meta-analysis demonstrated decreasing pooled effect over time, with contemporary studies after 2019 showing a tempered effect (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.20-1.39). CONCLUSIONS: Many studies attribute racial disparity in PCa to delayed presentation of disease, however, AS is unique since all AS eligible men have a low grade and stage PCa. Our findings suggest Black men may have an increased risk of progression during AS, but the association is not so strong that Black men should be discouraged from undergoing AS. Indeed, contemporary evidence suggests stricter inclusion, better confirmatory testing or better access to care may temper these findings. Importantly, these results utilize self-reported race, a social construct that has many limitations.",

There are limited studies regarding national level environmental exposures and PC aggressiveness, which was the focus of this study METHODS: SEER was queried to identify PC cases between 2010 and 2014. The environmental quality index (EQI) is a county-level metric for 2000-2005 combining data from 18 sources and reports an overall ambient environmental quality index, as well as 5 environmental quality sub-domains (air, water, land, built, and sociodemographic) with higher values representing lower environmental quality. PC stage at diagnosis was determined and, multivariable logistic regression models which adjusted for age at diagnosis (years) and self-reported race (White, Black, Other, Unknown) were used to test associations between quintiles of EQI scores and advanced PC stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: The study cohort included 252,164 PC cases, of which 92% were localized and 8% metastatic at diagnosis. In the adjusted regression models, overall environmental quality EQI (OR 1.20, CI 1.15-1.26), water EQI (OR: 1.34, CI: 1.27-1.40), land EQI (OR: 1.35, CI: 1.29-1.42) and sociodemographic EQI (OR: 1.29, CI: 1.23-1.35) were associated with metastatic PC at diagnosis. For these domains there was a dose response increase in the OR from the lowest to the highest quintiles of EQI. Black race was found to be an independent predictor of metastatic PC at diagnosis (OR: 1.36, CI: 1.30-1.42) and in stratified analysis by race; overall EQI was more strongly associated with metastatic PC in Black men (OR: 1.53, CI: 1.35-1.72) compared to White men (OR: 1.18, CI: 1.12-1.24). CONCLUSION(S): Lower environmental quality was associated with advanced stage PC at diagnosis. The water, land and sociodemographic domains showed the strongest associations. More work should be done to elucidate specific modifiable environmental factors associated with aggressive PC.",

Using a prostasphere-based label retention assay, we recently identified keratin 13 (KRT13)-enriched prostate stem cells at single-cell resolution, distinguishing them from daughter progenitors. Herein, we characterized the epithelial cell lineage hierarchy in prostaspheres using single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Keratin profiling revealed three clusters of label-retaining prostate stem cells; cluster I represents quiescent stem cells (PSCA, CD36, SPINK1, and KRT13/23/80/78/4 enriched), while clusters II and III represent active stem and bipotent progenitor cells (KRT16/17/6 enriched). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of stem and cancer-related pathways in cluster I. In non-label-retaining daughter progenitor cells, three clusters were identified; cluster IV represents basal progenitors (KRT5/14/6/16 enriched), while clusters V and VI represent early and late-stage luminal progenitors, respectively (KRT8/18/10 enriched). Furthermore, MetaCore analysis showed enrichment of the \"cytoskeleton remodeling-keratin filaments\" pathway in cancer stem-like cells from human prostate cancer specimens. Along with common keratins (KRT13/23/80/78/4) in normal stem cells, unique keratins (KRT10/19/6C/16) were enriched in cancer stem-like cells. Clarification of these keratin profiles in human prostate stem cell lineage hierarchy and cancer stem-like cells can facilitate the identification and therapeutic targeting of prostate cancer stem-like cells.",

The aim of the study is to evaluate anxiety levels in men on AS and how anxiety relates to disease characteristics and treatment decision-making. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using all 302 subjects from the Reduction by Dutasteride of clinical progression Events in Expectant Management (REDEEM) study. Prostate biopsies were obtained at 18 and 36 months. Anxiety was measured at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 36 months post-randomization using the MAX-PC (Memorial general anxiety scale for PCa) questionnaire. Univariable and multivariable analysis of the association of disease aggressiveness (PSA levels, percentage of positive cores, and maximum core involvement) and anxiety levels were performed. Cox regression was used to analyze time to progression to discontinuation of active surveillance as a function of baseline anxiety. RESULTS: Overall, MAX-PC scores decreased from moderate at baseline with slight increases after receiving PSA results at 18 months, followed by more decline. Percentage of positive cores was associated with baseline anxiety (P = 0.02). The association remained when controlling for age, race, number of cores sampled, body mass index, prostate volume, and maximum core length (P = 0.003). In univariable and multivariable analysis, baseline anxiety was not significantly associated with time to progression to discontinuation of active surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: In evaluating the natural history of anxiety levels among patients with prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance, there was a decline of anxiety levels over time, with increases after receiving PSA results. Moreover, we found that disease aggressiveness measured by percentage of positive biopsy cores was associated with baseline levels of anxiety. However, anxiety had no impact on clinical or therapeutic progression.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The Genomic Prostate Score (GPS), performed on biopsy tissue, predicts adverse outcome in prostate cancer (PCa) and has shown promise for improving patient selection for active surveillance (AS). However, its impact on treatment choice in high-risk populations of African Americans is largely unknown and, in general, the effect of the GPS on this difficult decision has not been evaluated in randomized trials. METHODS: Two hundred men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network very low to low-intermediate PCa from three Chicago hospitals (70% Black, 16% college graduates) were randomly assigned at diagnosis to standard counseling with or without a 12-gene GPS assay. The primary end point was treatment choice at a second postdiagnosis visit. The proportion of patients choosing AS was compared, and multivariable modeling was used to estimate the effects of various factors on AS acceptance. RESULTS: AS acceptance was high overall, although marginally lower in the intervention group (77% v 88%; P = .067), and lower still when men with inadequate specimens were excluded (P = .029). Men with lower health literacy who received a GPS were seven-fold less likely to choose AS compared with controls, whereas no difference was seen in men with higher health literacy (Pinteraction = .022). Among men with low-intermediate risk, 69% had GPS values consistent with unfavorable intermediate or high-risk cancer. AS choice was also independently associated with a family history of PCa and having health insurance. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other studies, the net effect of the GPS was to move patients away from AS, primarily among men with low health literacy. These findings have implications for our understanding of how prognostic molecular assays that generate probabilities of poor outcome can affect treatment decisions in diverse clinical populations.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Total pelvic exenterations (TPEs) for malignancies are complex operations often performed by multidisciplinary teams. The differences among primary cancer for TPE and multicentered results are not well described. We aimed to describe TPE outcomes for different malignant origins in a national multicentered sample. METHODS: Patients from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database who underwent TPE between 2005 and 2016 for all malignant indications (colorectal, gynecologic, urologic, or other) were included. Chi square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare patient characteristics by primary malignancy. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used to determine factors associated with any 30-day Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher complication, length of hospital stay (LOS; days), 30-day wound infection, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 2305 patients underwent TPE. Indications for surgery included 33% (749) colorectal, 15% (335) gynecologic, 9% (196) other, and 45% (1025) urologic malignancies. Median LOS decreased from 10 to 8 days during the study period (p < 0.001), 36% were males, and 50% required blood transfusion. High-grade complications occurred in 15% of patients and were associated with bowel diversion [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.4], disseminated cancer (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.3), and gynecologic cancers (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.8-4.7). Mortality was 2% and was associated with disseminated cancer (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.3) and male sex (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.4). CONCLUSIONS: TPE is associated with high rates of complications, however mortality rates remain low. Preoperative and perioperative outcomes differ depending on the origin of the primary malignancy.",

We aimed to identify subgroups within a Stockholm population with PC risk profiles matching American ethnicity-specific subgroups and compare the detection of PC and describe Stockholm3 performance within these subgroups. METHODS: All men age 49-70 years presenting for prostate biopsies were evaluated at UIC from 2016 to 2019, as well as men in Stockholm from 2012 to 2014 in the STHLM3 study. Propensity scores (PS) were estimated for each person using logistic regression for age, PSA, prostate volume, family history of PC, 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use, and prior biopsy. 3:1 PS matching was performed for Stockholm to Chicago ethnicity-specific cohorts and odds ratios (OR) were computed to compare detection of GG ≥ 2 PC between groups. RESULTS: 504 Chicago men and 6980 Stockholm men were included. In African American (AA) men, 51% had GG ≥ 2 PC detected, while in risk-matched Stockholm men, 34% had GG ≥ 2 PC detected (OR: 2.1, p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference in GG ≥ 2 PC detected when matching Stockholm men to non-Hispanic Caucasian men (31% vs. 24%, OR: 0.7, p = 0.30) or Hispanic Caucasian men (31% vs. 27%, OR: 1.2, p = 0.42). The AUC for the Stockholm3 test of the matched Stockholm cohorts for AA, non-Hispanic Caucasian, and Hispanic Caucasian men was 0.85, 0.89, and 0.90, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using statistical techniques to simulate a multi-ethnic Chicago cohort within the STHLM3 population, we found an excess risk of GG ≥ 2 PC among AA men. Our hypothesis that the Stockholm3 may have good predictive value in a multiethnic cohort is strengthened, and that recalibration to at least AA men seems likely to be needed to obtain well-calibrated predictions.",

Preclinical studies with the combination of hypomethylating agents and CPI resulted in reversal of immune evasion and tumor regression. We examined the combination of the hypomethylating agent guadecitabine (subcutaneously on Days 1-5), with the anti-PDL1 antibody durvalumab (intravenously at flat dose of 1500 mg on Day 8) in 28 day cycles in advanced RCC in a single arm trial. Methods: In the phase Ib portion (n=6; presented previously), guadecitabine dosing of 45 mg/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/day was selected as maximum tolerated dose. For the phase II portion of Cohort 1 (36 pts with no prior CPIs), eligible patients had metastatic RCC with clear cell component, ECOG PS of 0-1, and measurable disease by RECIST 1.1. We present pooled efficacy and toxicity data for the 42 CPI-naive pts from the phase Ib and phase II portions. An exploratory Cohort 2 (N=16) consisting of CPI-refractory pts is enrolling. Results: Of the 42 pts, 71% were men, median age was 67 years, ECOG PS was 0 in 57%, IMDC risk group was intermediate in 83% and poor in 17%, and histology was mixed in 21%. At a median follow-up of 20.1 m, best RECIST 1.1 response was PR in 9 pts (22%); SD in 25 pts (61%); PD in 7 pts (17%); and non-evaluable in 1 pt. Response categories were identical by irRECIST. Clinical benefit defined as either PR or SD ≥6 months was seen in 66%. Median OS had not been reached and median PFS was 17 m. Treatment was generally well tolerated with asymptomatic neutropenia the most frequent AE attributed to guadecitabine (38.1%), and asymptomatic lipase elevation the most common AE from durvalumab (11.9%). Grade 4 AEs were noted in 50.0% pts, grade 3 59.5%. Immune-mediated AEs were generally mild (all ≤ grade 3), included pruritus (14.3%), rash (14.3%), asymptomatic amylase or lipase elevations (16.7%), hypothyroidism (11.9%), diarrhea (16.7%), dyspnea (16.7%), pneumonitis (4.8%), myalgia (4.8%), and transaminitis (9.6%). Laboratory peripheral blood profiling (done at baseline, C1D8, C2D8) was associated on univariate unadjusted analysis at baseline with response in two major PBMC subsets - MDSCs (negative) and ILCs (positive). Further functional analysis revealed that increased expression of IL-22 in both CD4 and CD8 positive T cells positively correlated with response. Associations were noted for toxicity with IL-22 expressed by CD8-CD4- T cells, and CTLs T-bet level. Baseline archival tumor tissue next generation sequencing results will be presented. Conclusions: Guadecitabine in combination with durvalumab was well tolerated and had reasonable activity in first-line advanced ccRCC. MDSCs and regulatory T lymphocytes decreased in responders, increased Th17 subpopulations of T cells were associated with immune-mediated toxicities. Further study of this combination in CPI-refractory RCC pts is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT03308396 . </jats:p>",

The prostate gland is hormonally regulated, requiring steroids for proliferation and differentiation of secretory luminal cells. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of lethal prostate cancer, which exhibits a dedifferentiated pathology, linking vitamin D sufficiency to epithelial differentiation. To determine vitamin D regulation of prostatic epithelial differentiation, patient-derived benign prostate epithelial organoids were grown in vitamin D-deficient or -sufficient conditions. Organoids were assessed by phenotype and single-cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistic validation demonstrated that vitamin D sufficiency promoted organoid growth and accelerated differentiation by inhibiting canonical Wnt activity and suppressing Wnt family member DKK3. Wnt and DKK3 were also reduced by vitamin D in prostate tissue explants by spatial transcriptomics. Wnt dysregulation is a known contributor to aggressive prostate cancer, thus findings further link vitamin D deficiency to lethal disease.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite its success in the assessment of prostate cancer (PCa), in vivo multiparametric MRI has limitations such as interobserver variability and low specificity. Several MRI methods, among them MR elastography, are currently being discussed as candidates for supplementing conventional multiparametric MRI. This study aims to investigate the detection of PCa in fresh ex vivo human prostatectomy specimens using MR elastography. METHODS: Fourteen fresh prostate specimens from men with clinically significant PCa without formalin fixation or prior radiation therapy were examined by MR elastography at 500 Hz immediately after radical prostatectomy in a 9.4T preclinical scanner. Specimens were divided into 12 segments for both calculation of storage modulus (G' in kilopascals) and pathology (Gleason score) as reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated to assess PCa detection. RESULTS: The mean G' and SD were as follows: all segments, 8.74 ± 5.26 kPa; healthy segments, 5.44 ± 4.40 kPa; and cancerous segments, 10.84 ± 4.65 kPa. The difference between healthy and cancerous segments was significant with P ≤ .001. Diagnostic performance assessed with the Youden index was as follows: sensitivity, 69%; specificity, 79%; area under the curve, 0.81; and cutoff, 10.67 kPa. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that prostate MR elastography has the potential to improve diagnostic performance of multiparametric MRI, especially regarding its 2 major limitations: interobserver variability and low specificity. Particularly the high value for specificity in PCa detection is a stimulating result and encourages further investigation of this method.",

                  "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Introduction: The low specificity of PSA in prostate cancer (PCa) screening has caused excessive biopsies and PCa over-detection. PHI is more specific for clinically significant (cs) PCa (i.e. Gleason &amp;gt;6 PCa) and includes serum PSA, [-2]proPSA, and free PSA in its formula. Validation studies in diverse populations have suggested that PHI should be used as a reflex test and the optimal cutoffs for PHI vary across ethnic groups, but have not been determined in Black men. We sought to 1) assess the distributions of PHI and PSA in healthy controls and men with high-grade PCa and 2) assess the accuracy of PHI vs. PSA for detection of csPCa in Black men with elevated PSA. Methods: The present study population consists of two biopsy-naïve cohorts. The first cohort serves as healthy controls and includes Black men with PHI and PSA drawn at community screening events through the social networks of eight lay Black male Citizen Scientists. The second PHI Biopsy Study cohort consists of Black men referred with elevated PSA and/or abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE) who had PHI drawn immediately before prostate biopsy. We excluded men with prior biopsies or known PCa. Distributions of PHI and PSA were compared across controls and men with negative biopsies, Gleason 6 PCa and csPCa. Among men with biopsy, we compared the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) for PSA and PHI for detecting csPCa and assessed specificity at selected sensitivities as a proxy of avoided biopsies. We descriptively assessed theoretically avoided biopsies and missed csPCa at previously established PHI cut points [27.0, 28.6, 29.9, and 35.0]. Results: For the first objective, 139 men (42.5%) were included as controls from the Citizens Scientist Study and 188 (57.5%) were from the PHI Biopsy Study cohort, out of which 82 (43.6%) had a negative biopsy for PCa, 40 (21.1%) had low-grade PCa, and 66 (35.1%) had a Gleason &amp;gt;6 PCa. Compared to the healthy control group, the PHI Biopsy Study cohort was older (median age 61 vs. 55 years), with higher PSA levels (7.1ng/mL vs. 0.9ng/mL) and PHI scores (61.1 vs. 20.1), and more commonly had a family history of PCa (19.4% vs. 5.0%) and benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosis (21.3% vs. 2.2%) (all p&amp;lt;0.001). Relative to PSA, PHI has a higher degree of overlap in the distribution between controls and csPCas (p &amp;lt;0.05), suggesting PHI would not perform well as a primary screening test in Blacks. In men with PSA between 4-10, PHI outperformed PSA in the detection of HGPCa with an AUC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.59-0.81) compared to 0.57 (95% CI: 0.46-0.69). As a reflex test in men with PSA of 4-10ng/mL and normal DRE, a PHI cutoff of 35.0 would spare 20 (27.8%) low-risk men a biopsy while missing 2 (7.4%) csPCas. Conclusion: PHI should not be used for primary screening but has higher accuracy and specificity than PSA in Black men with PSA levels of 4-10ng/mL as a reflex test. At a cutoff of 35.0, 28% of low-risk men avoid biopsy while missing 7% of csPCas.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Samuel Carbunaru, Oluwarotimi Nettey, Edward M Schaeffer, Peter H Gann, Michael Abern, Courtney M.P Hollowell, Karriem Watson, Tiffany McDowell, Rick A Kittles, Adam B Murphy.

The assay output provided to the patient and clinician is a predicted probability. While these studies confirm the ability of the assay to discriminate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer (PCa), the assay’s actual clinical utility, in terms of its impact on treatment choice and psychological factors, has not been determined. Moreover, the assay’s utility for African American (AA) men remains an important knowledge gap for programs aimed at reducing PCa disparities through judicious use of active surveillance (AS). ENACT (Engaging Newly Diagnosed Men About Cancer Treatment Options) is an ongoing randomized trial comparing standard National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) based treatment counseling plus ODX to NCCN-based counseling alone for a largely AA population of men eligible for AS. The primary aim is to quantify the effect of ODX on treatment, testing the hypothesis that the assay causes a net migration towards AS. Secondary aims measure effects on psychological metrics dealing with cancer-related anxiety, decision conflict, and decision regret. Completion of the trial is expected in Fall 2019. Patients are enrolled at the UI Hospital, Stroger-Cook County Hospital and the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago. Eligibility criteria include: biopsy-proven PCa with NCCN risk level Very Low, Low or Low Intermediate, age ⇐ 76, and estimated life expectancy &amp;gt;10 years. Thus far, 201 patients have enrolled and 180 have completed all study visits. Randomization (stratified by race and NCCN risk) occurs at Visit 1, when patients receive their diagnosis and initial counseling, and treatment decision is finalized at Visit 2, 2-3 weeks later. At Visit 3, ≈4 weeks after the decision but before treatment, surveys capture information about decision conflict and changes from Visit 1 in perceived cancer-related risk/mood. At Visit 4, ≈4 months after treatment starts, final surveys capture data on regret and evaluation of the decision process. Additional surveys record treatment preference of the attending urologist before and after the final decision. The enrolled population thus far is 71% AA, 35% age &amp;lt;60, and 42% NCCN Very Low risk, 33% Low risk, and 25% Low Intermediate risk. Drop-out for the primary endpoint is &amp;lt;5%. The data analysis will explore potential effect modification by race, risk level, health literacy, marital status, and relative vs. absolute change in predicted risk. The unique design of the ENACT trial raises questions about the need to evaluate predictive biomarkers, which are decision support tools, based on their actual impact on decision quality, especially for patients affected by a racial disparity in outcomes. The advent of multiplex biomarkers that provide clinicians and patients with probabilities rather than binary results adds to the complexity and the urgency of this need.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Format: Adam B Murphy, Samuel Carbunaru, Michael Abern, Courtney MP Hollowell, Roohollah Sharifi, Peter H.

In this report we describe our step-by-step approach, technical modifications from the multi-port technique and initial results for performing single port robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (SP-RALP). We describe our initial experience and technique with the SP robotic system consisting of 23 consecutive patients who underwent SP-RALP between December 2018 and May 2019. The median patient age was 62 years with approximately half of the patients undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy. The median operative time was 236 minutes, median estimated blood loss was 50 mL and median length of hospital stay was 1 day. No unplanned port placements occurred and no conversions to open surgery occurred.

                  "abstract": "Single-port (SP) robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) appears to be a safe and feasible approach for radical prostatectomy, but no prior studies have compared SP-RALP to a multiport (MP) platform. Using retrospective data from a single-center tertiary institution we compare 50 consecutive SP-RALP patients (da Vinci SP) to a contemporary cohort of 113 patients who underwent MP-RALP (da Vinci Xi). We found no significant differences in surgical or total operating room time. Pain scores were measured on a scale from 0 to 10. There were more pain-free patients on postoperative day 1 (18% difference, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.9-27%) and there were shorter hospital stays (-1 d, 95% CI -1.0 to 0) in favor of SP. There were no significant differences in inpatient total morphine equivalents used, complication rates, or stress incontinence determined at a minimum of 90 d. These findings show that the learning curve for SP-RALP is relatively short for an experienced robotic surgeon and may favor better pain control and shorter hospitalization. PATIENT SUMMARY: We analyzed the differences in robotic surgery for localized prostate cancer using a single-port robotic platform compared to the traditional multiport robotic platform. We did not find significant differences in operative times, but significantly more patients were pain-free on the first postoperative day and had shorter hospital stays.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: We compared intraoperative and perioperative outcomes between extraperitoneal and transperitoneal radical prostatectomy performed using a \"purpose-designed\" single port robotic platform. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 98 patients underwent single port robotic prostatectomy using the da Vinci SP® robotic system with extraperitoneal (group I, 52) vs transperitoneal (group II, 46) approach. Demographics and perioperative data including postoperative recovery outcomes were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Groups were similar in terms of demographics and prostate cancer risk category. Mean operative time (201±37.5 vs 248.2±42.3 minutes, p <0.00001) as well as median postoperative hospital stay (4.3 vs 25.7 hours p <0.0001) was significantly shorter with the extraperitoneal approach. Overall need for pain medications or narcotics as well as the required amount of narcotics per patient (if administered) were significantly lower with the extraperitoneal approach. Extraprostatic extension was detected in 48.1% vs 41.3% of patients in groups I and II, respectively. Surgical margins were positive in 26.9% in group I vs 41.3% in group II (p=0.13). More than 80% of patients with positive surgical margins had high risk features on final surgical pathology. The 90-day continence rate was similar between the 2 groups (60% vs 62.5%, p=0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Extraperitoneal and transperitoneal single port robotic radical prostatectomy are safe and feasible approaches. The extraperitoneal approach is associated with a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay and decreased need for postoperative narcotics. Randomized trials with adequate sample size and postoperative followup are advisable for further evaluation of the outcomes to clarify patient selection criteria for each approach.",

Missed clinic appointments have undesirable effects on the patient, health system, and society, and treatment delays have been shown to result in inferior surgical cure rates for men with prostate cancer (CaP). We sought to measure the impact of patient navigation on CaP clinic adherence. Patient navigators contacted patients prior to their first encounter for known or suspected CaP between 7/1/2016 and 6/30/2017. Encounters from 7/1/2014 to 6/30/2015 were used as a historical control. Patient-variables were analyzed including age, health insurance status, home address, zip code, race, ethnicity, and referring primary care clinic. Encounter-level variables included diagnosis (categorized as known or suspected CaP), date of appointment, type of appointment [new vs. return], and provider. The associations between several factors including navigation contact and these variables with missed appointment were analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects multivariate logistic regression. A total of 2854 scheduled clinic encounters from 986 unique patients were analyzed. Patient navigation resulted in a lower missed appointment rate (8.8% vs. 13.9%, OR = 0.64, IQR 0.44-0.93, p = 0.02 on multivariable analysis). Lack of health insurance (OR = 13.18 [5.13-33.83]), suspected but not confirmed CaP diagnosis (OR = 7.44 [4.85-11.42]), and Black (1.97 [1.06-3.65]) or Hispanic (OR = 3.61 [1.42-9.16]) race, were associated with missed appointment. Implementation of patient navigation reduced missed appointment rates for CaP related ambulatory encounters. Identifying risk factors for missed appointment may aid in targeting navigation services to those most likely to benefit from this intervention.",

Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. METHODS: To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=1.57, 95% CI=1.39-1.78, P<0.001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=1.32, 95% CI=1.20-1.47, P<0.001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.05-1.32, P=0.005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=1.16, 95% CI=1.02-1.31, P=0.03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97, P=0.01). Burnout was higher in high-income countries (HICs) compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (RR=1.18; 95% CI=1.02-1.36, P=0.018). INTERPRETATION: Burnout is prevalent at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued an updated recommendation statement on serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)-based screening for PCa. Specifically, in 2012, the USPSTF recommended against PSA-based screening due to risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. However, the updated 2018 guidelines recommend consideration of screening for certain at risk men and revised the recommendation rating from \"D\" to \"C.\" This new guideline recommends providers to educate high-risk men on the benefits and harms of PSA-based PCa screening so that they can make an informed decision. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes provisions of service coverage for patient navigators who can help patients decide whether screening is appropriate, given potential risks and benefits, and training of health care providers in shared-decision regarding screening/treatment. These services can be utilized to support health care providers to better adhere to the new guideline. However, recommendations that are given a C rating or lower are not consistently reimbursed through many plans, including those offered through the ACA marketplace. The Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) supports the USPSTF guideline for the consideration of prostate cancer screening for high-risk men between the ages of 55 and 69. SBM encourages policymakers to include provisions for coverage of patient navigation services in the ACA to facilitate shared decision-making between providers and patients regarding screening.",

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 3295 men undergoing a 2-year prostate biopsy following a negative prestudy biopsy in the placebo arm of the Reduction by Dutasteride of PCa Events (REDUCE) study. Men were divided in 2 groups based on testosterone level < or ≥300 ng/dL. Diagnostic properties of total serum PSA, free-PSA ratio, and PSA density to predict PCa and csPCa, defined as Gleason score ≥7, were determined for several thresholds and plotted as receiver operator characteristic curves. RESULTS: A total of 603 men (18.3%) had low testosterone. The prevalence of PCa and csPCa was 92 (15.3%) and 27 (4.5%), respectively, for low testosterone men compared to 458 (17.0%) and 138 (5.1%), correspondingly, for normal testosterone men. Total PSA, free-PSA ratio and PSA density showed similar sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to predict PCa and csPCa among low testosterone men compared to normal testosterone men. CONCLUSION: Among subjects in a clinical trial with a prior negative biopsy, total PSA, free-PSA ratio and PSA density have comparable diagnostic characteristics for PCa screening in low and normal testosterone men.",

METHODS: Residents from 6 Chicago area urology programs participated in a MRI/US fusion biopsy workshop, which incorporated a 30 minute didactic session followed by hands-on simulation. The workshop was facilitated by fellowship-trained university faculty members and company representatives of MRI/US fusion technologies who provided teaching assistance and verbal feedback. Participants completed pre- and post-test nonvalidated 4-item questionnaires graded on a Likert scale. Information on resident prior experience with TRUS and MRI/US fusion biopsies was also collected. Pre-and postquestionnaires were compared with paired t tests for each survey domain (P <.05 were considered significant). RESULTS: Thirty-three residents (PGY 1-6, median PGY 3) participated in the workshop. 13 (40.6%) residents reported performing between 51 and 100 TRUS biopsies previously. Twenty-one (65.6%) reported being familiar with PIRADS v2 interpretation of prostate MR imaging, however 17 (53.1%) had never previously performed a MRI/US fusion biopsy. Analysis of pre- and post-test questionnaires showed significant increases in all 4 survey domains (P <.05). Residents demonstrated increased familiarity with indications for fusion biopsy (mean difference = +0.59), preparation for fusion biopsy (mean difference = +1.16), methods of MRI to TRUS image registration (mean difference = +1.38), and the advantages/disadvantages of perineal vs TRUS fusion biopsy (mean difference = +1.25). CONCLUSION: This workshop model which combines didactics followed by hands-on simulation training is an effective method for increasing the knowledge and familiarity with MRI/US fusion biopsy of trainees.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: WNT signaling is implicated in embryonic development, and in adult tissue homeostasis, while its deregulation is evident in disease. This study investigates the unique roles of canonical WNT10B in both normal prostate development and prostate cancer (PCa) progression. METHODS: Organ culture and rat ventral prostates (VPs) were used to study Wnt10b ontogeny and growth effect of WNT10B protein. PB-SV40 LTag rat VPs were utilized for Wnt expression polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array and immunohistochemistry. Human localized PCa tissue microarrays (TMAs) were investigated for differential WNT10B expression. Human RNA-seq data sets were queried for differential expression of WNT10B in metastatic and localized PCa. Knockdown of WNT10B in PC3 cells was utilized to study its effects on proliferation, stemness, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and xenograft propagation. RESULTS: Wnt10b expression was highest at birth and rapidly declined in the postnatal rat VP. Exogenous WNT10B addition to culture developing VPs decreased growth suggesting an antiproliferative role. VPs from PB-SV40 LTag rats with localized PCa showed a 25-fold reduction in Wnt10b messenger RNA (mRNA) expession, confirmed at the protein level. Human PCa TMAs revealed elevated WNT10B protein in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia compared with normal prostates but reduced levels in localized PCa specimens. In contrast, RNA-seq data set of annotated human PCa metastasis found a significant increase in WNT10B mRNA expression compared with localized tumors suggesting stage-specific functions of WNT10B. Similarly, WNT10B mRNA levels were increased in metastatic cell lines PC3, PC3M, as well as in HuSLC, a PCa stem-like cell line, as compared with disease-free primary prostate epithelial cells. WNT10B knockdown in PC3 cells reduced expression of EMT genes, MMP9 and stemness genes NANOG and SOX2 and markedly reduced the stem cell-like side population. Furthermore, loss of WNT10B abrogated the ability of PC3 cells to propagate tumors via serial transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest a dual role for WNT10B in normal development and in PCa progression with opposing functions depending on disease stage. We propose that decreased WNT10B levels in localized cancer allow for a hyperproliferative state, whereas increased levels in advanced disease confer a stemness and malignant propensity which is mitigated by knocking down WNT10B levels. This raises the potential for WNT10B as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in metastatic PCa.",

                  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant rectal vault flora is associated with infectious complications in men undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy (TRUS-PNB). OBJECTIVE: To determine the patient factors that predict FQ-resistant rectal cultures in men who are undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy. METHODS: An IRB approved retrospective review of 6183 consecutive men who had undergone a rectal swab culture in preparation for TRUS-PNB between January 2013 and December 2014 was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the clinical and demographic factors associated with FQ-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the rectal vault. RESULTS: Of the 6179 rectal swabs analyzed, 4842 (78%) were FQ-sensitive, and 1337 (22%) were FQ-resistant. On univariable analysis, increasing age, prior TRUS-PNB, higher number of biopsy cores obtained, diabetes mellitus, antimicrobial use within the past 6 months and non-Caucasian race were predictors of FQ-resistance (all p < 0.05). Men with FQ-resistant cultures were more likely to have benign pathology on TRUS-PNB (p = 0.004). On multivariable analysis, increasing patient age (OR = 1.01/year [1.00-1.02]), use of antimicrobials in the last 6 months (OR = 2.85[2.18-3.72]), African American (OR = 1.99 [1.66-2.37]), Asian (OR = 3.39 [2.63-4.37]), and Hispanic (OR = 2.10 [1.72-2.55]) races were independently associated with FQ-resistant rectal cultures. The overall infectious rate was 1.1% (56/5214) and the sepsis rate was 0.46% (24/5214). The infection rate in the FQ-resistant group was 3.9% (43/1107) compared to FQ-sensitive group 0.3% (13/4107), p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: In this cohort, increasing age, recent antimicrobial-use, and non-Caucasian race were independent predictors of FQ-resistance in the rectal vault. As FQ-resistance is associated with infectious complications from transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy, understanding risk factors may assist infection control efforts.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hormonal influences such as androgens and estrogens are known contributors in the development and progression of prostate cancer (CaP). While much of the research to the hormonal nature of CaP has focused on androgens, estrogens also have critical roles in CaP development, physiology as well as a potential therapeutic intervention. METHODS: In this review, we provide a critical literature review of the current basic science and clinical evidence for the interaction between estrogens and CaP. RESULTS: Estrogenic influences in CaP include synthetic, endogenous, fungi and plant-derived compounds, and represent a family of sex hormones, which cross hydrophobic cell membranes and bind to membrane-associated receptors and estrogen receptors that localize to the nucleus triggering changes in gene expression in various organ systems. CONCLUSIONS: Estrogens represent a under-recognized contributor in CaP development and progression. Further research in this topic may provide opportunities for identification of environmental influencers as well as providing novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of CaP.",

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 72,134 adult Hispanics with PCa between 1995 and 2014. Origin was Mexican (N = 16,995; 24%), South/Central American (N = 6949; 10%), Puerto Rican (N = 3582; 5%), Cuban (N = 2587; 4%), Dominican (N = 725; 1%), Hispanic not specified (NOS, N = 41,296; 57%), as coded by SEER. Patient and PCa characteristics were analyzed with chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Overall and PCa survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox models adjusting for baseline variables. RESULTS: At diagnosis, Mexicans had more advanced stage, higher prostate-specific antigen, and higher Gleason score while Cubans and Dominicans had more favorable PCa at diagnosis (all P < 0.05). After a median follow-up of 69 months, 20,317 men died, including 6223 PCa deaths. Compared to Mexicans, Cubans (HR = 1.22, 95% CI = [1.14-1.30]) and Puerto Ricans (HR = 1.15 [1.08-1.22]) had worse overall survival while Dominicans (HR = 0.76 [0.64-0.91]), South/Central Americans (HR = 0.68 [0.65-0.72]), and NOS (HR = 0.81 [0.78-0.84]) had better overall survival. Compared to Mexicans, Cubans (HR = 1.08 [0.96-1.22]) and Puerto Ricans (HR = 1.03 [0.92-1.15]) had similar PCa survival while Dominicans (HR = 0.72 [0.53-0.98]), South/Central Americans (HR = 0.67 [0.60-0.74]), and NOS (HR = 0.68 [0.64-0.73]) had significantly better PCa survival. CONCLUSIONS: Among Hispanics in the United States, disparities in PCa characteristics and survival by country of origin exist, with Dominicans, South/Central Americans, and Hispanic NOS having better PCa survival compared to Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans.",

METHODS: We cast our phantom from polyvinylchloride-plastisol that features 10 mm and 5 mm blue clay tumors, a urethral lumen, and an echogenic capsule. T2-weighted images were acquired with a 3T MR750 scanner (GE Healthcare, Boston, MA). Fusion testing was performed on the bkFusion system (BK ultrasound, Peabody, MA) with MIM Symphony software (MIM, Cleveland, OH) and an 18-gauge Bard Monopty disposable gun (Bard, Murray Hill, NJ). Twenty residents from 6 urology programs in Chicago performed proctored user testing. RESULTS: The per phantom material cost was $12. The phantom was compatible with all necessary equipment to create a MRI/US fusion data set. MRI and US imaging characteristics were excellent with hypointense lesions. Image fusion was achieved through both end and side fire ultrasound probes. The phantom allowed for biopsies to be performed, and target lesion hits were confirmed by visual inspection of core samples. 38% (8/21) of urology resident pilot testing participants had previously performed a fusion biopsy. The mean postsession survey scores were (1-10 [best]): realism 9.0, usefulness 9.4, ease of use 9.1, ease of orientation 8.9, and overall experience 9.3. CONCLUSION: This simple and inexpensive phantom allows for training and accuracy testing of MRI/US fusion biopsy hardware and software platforms.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Prostate biopsy complications have important consequences that may affect patient compliance with rebiopsy schemes. However, to our knowledge this has not been studied in earnest. Thus, we evaluated whether previous prostate biopsy related complications and the type of complication were associated with repeat prostate biopsy compliance in a clinical trial with study mandated systematic biopsies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 4,939 men 50 to 75 years old who underwent 2-year prostate biopsy and were recommended to undergo 4-year prostate rebiopsy in the REDUCE (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) study. The analyzed biopsy complications were hematuria, urinary tract infection, acute urinary retention and hemospermia. RESULTS: A total of 260 men (5.3%) had a 2-year prostate biopsy related complication, including hematuria in 180 (3.6%), urinary tract infection in 36 (0.7%), acute urinary retention in 26 (0.5%) and hemospermia in 102 (2.1%). A total of 474 men (9.6%) were noncompliant with 4-year rebiopsy. On univariable analysis any previous complication (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.08-2.24, p = 0.018), urinary tract infection (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.23-6.00, p = 0.013), acute urinary retention (OR 4.24, 95% CI 1.83-9.81, p = 0.016) and hemospermia (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.06, p = 0.037) were associated with rebiopsy noncompliance. Hematuria was not associated with rebiopsy noncompliance (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.74-1.91, p = 0.483). Results were unchanged on multivariable analysis, including for any complication (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018), for urinary tract infection (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.07-3.21, p = 0.029), for acute urinary retention (OR 4.51, 95% CI 1.93-10.54, p = 0.001), for hemospermia (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07-3.21, p = 0.029) and for hematuria (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.74-1.93, p = 0.472). CONCLUSIONS: In men who undergo repeat prostate biopsy a previous biopsy related complication and the type of complication were associated with lower compliance with rebiopsy schemes. Patients who experience biopsy related complications are ideal candidates to receive intervention regarding the importance of prostate rebiopsy to prevent noncompliance.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 1,056 consecutive patients undergoing surgical treatment (radical or partial nephrectomy) for clinically localized RCC between 2000 to 2010. Demographic (age, race, and sex) clinical (preoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit, type of surgery [partial or radical nephrectomy]), and pathological (T and N stages, RCC histotype, grade) data were compared between patients receiving perioperative (intraoperative or postoperative) blood transfusions and those who are not. Distant and local recurrence-free survival, overall survival, RCC-specific survival were recorded and Kaplan-Meier survival curves as well as multivariable proportional regression models adjusted for clinical and pathological characteristics were produced. RESULTS: On multivariable analyses adjusted for clinical and pathological characteristics, the receipt of ABTs was associated with lower recurrence-free (HR = 1.86, P = 0.002), overall (HR = 1.83, P = 0.016), and RCC-specific survival (HR = 2.12, P = 0.031). The negative effect of ABTs was apparent for distant (HR = 2.24, P<0.001) but not local recurrences (HR = 0.78, P = 0.643). Limitations include retrospective nature and lack of uniform criteria for blood transfusion during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, perioperative ABTs were independently associated with worse oncological outcomes in patients with clinically localized RCC. Receipt of ABT was associated with roughly a 2-fold increase in the hazard of metastatic progression, all-cause and RCC-specific mortality. Further research is needed on the mechanisms of transfusion-induced immunomodulation, alternative transfusion protocols and methods for autologous blood transfusion and recovery.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched Embase®, PubMed® and Web of Science™ from January 1, 1990 to October 1, 2016 for abstracts containing the key words prostate cancer, inflammation and biopsy. Study inclusion criteria were original research, adult human subjects, cohort or case-control study design, histological inflammation on prostate needle biopsy and prostate cancer on histology. Two independent teams reviewed abstracts and extracted data from the selected manuscripts. Combined ORs and 95% CIs of any, acute and chronic inflammation were calculated using the random effects method. RESULTS: Of the 1,030 retrieved abstracts 46 underwent full text review and 25 were included in the final analysis, comprising a total of 20,585 subjects and 6,641 patients with prostate cancer. There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 84.4%, p <0.001). The presence of any inflammation was significantly associated with a lower prostate cancer risk in 25 studies (OR 0.455, 95% CI 0.337-0.573). There was no evidence of publication bias (p >0.05). When subanalyzed by inflammation type, acute inflammation in 4 studies and chronic inflammation in 15 were each associated with a lower prostate cancer risk (OR 0.681, 95% CI 0.450-0.913 and OR 0.499, 95% CI 0.334-0.665, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of 25 studies inflammation on prostate needle biopsy was associated with a lower prostate cancer risk. Clinically the presence of inflammation on prostate needle biopsy may lower the risk of a subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis.",

Missed clinic appointments (MA) are one form of non-adherence that may be preventable. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1341 scheduled clinic encounters for men referred to an academic urology clinic for evaluation of known or suspected CaP. Driving distance and public transit times were calculated using a Google Distance Matrix API algorithm. Zip code level data regarding socioeconomic status was obtained from the 2013 American Community Survey. Logistic regression multivariate analysis was used to identify MA predictors. Of scheduled clinic encounters, 14% were missed. Public health insurance was associated with MA (Private insurance 10%, Public insurance 19%), (p < 0.01) Calendar month was associated with MA with December showing the highest rate (21.2%) and June the lowest (5.3%) rates. (p = 0.02) Appointments for suspected CaP were more likely to be missed (19.3%) than those for known CaP (10.5%), p < 0.01. Driving distance was inversely associated with rate of MA (CA median 11.8 miles, MA median 10.4 miles, p = 0.04) while public transit times were not (66.7 min for CA, 65.3 min for MA, p = 0.36). Men that missed appointments were from areas with lower household incomes and educational attainment. Patient encounter type, insurance status, and reason for referral remained significantly associated with MA after multivariable adjusted analysis. By computing public transit time to the clinic using a mapping engine, we present a novel way to measure this parameter for studies of urban health care.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The incidence of infectious complications after transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy is rising. We sought to identify the incidence and predictors of infection in a large cohort of men undergoing biopsy who receive targeted prophylaxis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 5,214 consecutive patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy from January 2013 to December 2014 at UroPartners, a large urology group comprising 28 clinics in metropolitan Chicago. At 1 microbiology laboratory all swabs were processed, the presence of fluoroquinolone resistant gram-negative rods was identified and sensitivity tests were performed. Prophylaxis for biopsy was guided by rectal swab culture. Characteristics of patients with and without infectious complications were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic regression was done to determine predictors of infectious complications. Analyses were performed with R, version 2.14.2 (https://www.r-project.org/). RESULTS: Of the 5,214 biopsies performed 56 infectious (1.1%) and 24 sepsis complications (0.46%) were found. On univariable analysis nonCaucasian race and fluoroquinolone resistant microbes were predictors of infection (p <0.05). On multivariable analysis fluoroquinolone resistant rectal vault flora (OR 9.98, 95% CI 3.79-26.3) and the number of biopsy cores taken (OR 1.28 per core, 95% CI 1.04-1.54) were independent predictors of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Despite targeted prophylaxis patients with fluoroquinolone resistant rectal vault flora have higher odds of infectious complications following transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy. In these patients one should consider using other biopsy approaches or techniques to minimize risk.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Residents from 6 area urology training programs rotated through simulation stations in 4 consecutive sessions from 2014 to 2017. Workshops included GreenLight photovaporization of the prostate, ureteroscopic stone extraction, laparoscopic peg transfer, 3-dimensional laparoscopy rope pass, transobturator sling placement, intravesical injection, high definition video system trainer, vasectomy, and Urolift. Faculty members provided teaching assistance, objective scoring, and verbal feedback. Participants completed a nonvalidated questionnaire evaluating utility of the workshop and soliciting suggestions for improvement. RESULTS: Sixty-three of 75 participants (84%) (postgraduate years 1-6) completed the exit questionnaire. Median rating of exercise usefulness on a scale of 1-10 ranged from 7.5 to 9. On a scale of 0-10, cumulative median scores of the course remained high over 4 years: time limit per station (9; interquartile range [IQR] 2), faculty instruction (9, IQR 2), ease of use (9, IQR 2), face validity (8, IQR 3), and overall course (9, IQR 2). On multivariate analysis, there was no difference in rating of domains between postgraduate years. Sixty-seven percent (42/63) believe that simulation training should be a requirement of Urology residency. Ninety-seven percent (63/65) viewed the laboratory as beneficial to their education. CONCLUSION: This workshop model is a valuable training experience for residents. Most participants believe that surgical simulation is beneficial and should be a requirement for Urology residency. High ratings of usefulness for each exercise demonstrated excellent face validity provided by the course.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current evidence on risk of prostate cancer following a diagnosis of male breast cancer is limited and guidance for screening in this potentially higher-risk population remainsunclear. Our objective was to quantify prostate cancer risk in men diagnosed with breast cancer. METHODS: We identified men diagnosed with first primary breast cancer between 1988 and 2012 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program registry databases. Men were followed for occurrence of a second primary prostate cancer and secondary outcomes of cancer-specific and overall survival. Stratified analyses were performed by age, breast cancer stage, race, and breast cancer hormone receptor status. Excess risk per 10,000 person-years and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. We used multivaraible Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI for characteristics associated with secondary prostate cancer and survival. RESULTS: From a cohort of 5753 men with breast cancer with median follow up of 4.3 years, we identified 250 cases of second primary prostate cancer. Overall, the incidence of second primary prostate cancer was modestly greater than expected (SIR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.93-1.33), although not statistically significant. Stratified analyses demonstrated associations for men ages 65-74 at the time of breast cancer diagnosis (SIR = 1.34, 95%CI 1.01-1.73), hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (SIR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.11-1.39) or AJCC stage I breast cancer (SIR = 1.36, 95%CI 1.04-1.75) and second primary prostate cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of prostate cancer in men with history of breast cancer is similar to the general population. Men with favorable characteristics of their breast cancer were more likely to develop prostate cancer, possibly due to a lower competing risk of breast cancer mortality.",

While the introduction of widespread PSA testing has been associated with a downward stage migration, whether this trend continues in the late PSA era and for black men is unknown. The objective of our study was to evaluate current PC stage migration patterns in the United States by race. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry was queried to obtain all cases of PC reported between 2000 and 2013. Year of diagnosis was categorized into 2000-2003, 2004-2007, 2008-2010 and 2011-2013. Predictors of distant stage PC at diagnosis were determined using logistic regression adjusted for year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, SEER region and race. RESULTS: A total of 791 184 PC cases were identified. The cohort comprised 78.9% (n=594 920) white and 14.1% (n=106 133) black men. The stage at diagnosis was 83.3% localized, 12.0% regional and 4.7% distant. Age-adjusted incidence demonstrated a steady decline for black men in all time groups while white men had a stable incidence of distant disease between 2000 and 2013. In univariate analysis, black men in the 2004-2007 (OR 0.86 (0.81-0.93)) and 2008-2010 cohorts (OR 0.85 (0.79-0.91)) were less likely to be diagnosed with metastatic PC as compared with the 2000-2003 baseline cohort. In multivariate analysis, the 2004-2007 black cohort was less likely to be diagnosed with distant PC (OR 0.90 (0.84-0.97)). This trend was not observed in white men who in multivariate analysis had an increased risk of distant PC in the 2004-2007 (OR 1.08 (1.04-1.11)), 2008-2010 (OR 1.22 (1.18-1.27)) and 2011-2013 (OR 1.65 (1.59-1.71)) groups. CONCLUSIONS: PC downward stage migration continues in black men but not in white men. Discontinuation of PSA-based screening for PC could disproportionately affect black men.",

Long standing beliefs of androgen suppression conferring a protective effect against prostate cancer development have been challenged by the literature citing adenocarcinoma development in the prostate of rodent models following combined estrogen and testosterone treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We herein present a MtFT patient who presented with high grade PCa following 20 years of exogenous estrogen therapy. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical (IHC) localization of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α) and progesterone receptor (PR) demonstrated positive staining in stromal cells; while, androgen receptor (AR) demonstrated positive staining in malignant glands and weak scattered staining in adjacent stroma. CONCLUSION: This pattern of staining raises concern for a possible contributing role of exogenous estrogen therapy in tumorigenesis. As awareness of gender dysphoria and acceptance of gender reassignment surgery has seen a recent increase, the unique needs of this population must be recognized.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging followed by three-dimensional transperineal template mapping biopsy was carried out. For imaging and pathology data, the prostate was divided in octants with the urethra being the midline. The index test properties were calculated using the biopsy histopathology as the reference test with the following end-points: any cancer, any Gleason ≥7, any Gleason ≥7 or cancer length of ≥4 mm and any Gleason ≥7 or 6 mm in any given core. The latter two definitions correspond to 0.2 and 0.5 mL of cancer volume, respectively. Diagnostic properties including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were included in the study. A median of 55 (interquartile range 42-63) biopsy cores were obtained per patient. Of 400 prostate octants evaluated, 28.5% had prostate cancer on mapping biopsy, whereas 23% of octants were considered suspicious for cancer on imaging. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging negative predictive values for Gleason ≥7 and clinically significant cancers were 84-100%. Similarly, specificity ranged between 79% and 85%. Sensitivity and positive predictive value remained moderate for all the reference test definitions. CONCLUSIONS: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is a useful minimally-invasive tool for detection, localization and characterization of prostate cancer. This imaging modality has high negative predictive value and specificity, and therefore it could be used to reliably rule out clinically significant cancer, obviating the multicore mapping biopsy.",

OBJECTIVE: We examine the performance of the urine-based TWIST1/NID2 methylation assay with the addition of urine cytology for the detection of urothelial carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective multi-institutional study was conducted to assess the performance of a methylation assay for patients with hematuria or under surveillance for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). All patients underwent cystoscopy, a methylation assay, and cytology. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for cytology alone, the methylation assay alone, and a combined model. Areas under the curve (AUC) were compared using likelihood ratio tests. RESULTS: A total of 172 patients were enrolled (37% for hematuria and 63% NMIBC). The AUC for cytology alone with equivocal cytologies positive was 0.704, and improved to 0.773 with the addition of the DNA methylation assay (p < 0.001). When the equivocal cytologies were considered negative, the AUC improved from 0.558 to 0.697 with the addition of the DNA methylation assay (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of a TWIST1/NID2-based DNA methylation assay adds diagnostic value to urine cytology and the model is sensitive to the classification of equivocal cytology.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 29-38% of all positive surgical margins (PSMs) at radical prostatectomy (RP) involve the apex. The prognostic significance of apical PSM remains unclear. We therefore compared the long-term oncologic outcomes of men with apical PSMs to those with negative PSMs, apical and other PSMs, and other PSMs at RP. METHODS: The SEARCH (Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital) database was used to identify 4031 men with prostate cancer (PCa) managed with RP with complete pathologic grade and stage data. Margin status was categorized as negative, apex only, or other positive. Multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for pathologic stage and grade were developed to test the relationship between margin status and biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastases and PCa death. RESULTS: In the final cohort, 34.3% had PSMs, whereas 65.7% had negative margins. Univariable analysis showed that compared with negative margins, apex-only PSM was associated with BCR (hazard ratio (HR): 1.4 [1.1-1.8]), but not metastases or PCa death, whereas apex and other PSMs were associated with BCR (HR: 3.3 [2.8-4]) and metastases (HR: 1.8 [1.02-3.1]) but not PCa death. Nonapical PSMs were associated with BCR (HR: 2.7 [2.4-3.1]), metastases (1.7 [1.2-2.5)] and PCa death (1.8 [1.05-3]). On multivariable analysis, apex-only, apex and other, and nonapical PSMs were associated with BCR but margin status was not associated with metastases or PCa death. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of men undergoing RP, those with PSMs at the prostatic apex had lower BCR, metastases, or PCa death compared with those with PSMs at other locations. When adjusted for pathologic stage and grade, however, PSMs were associated with BCR but not long-term oncologic outcomes. These data confirm that men with apex-only PSMs may not be ideal candidates for adjuvant therapy after RP.",

Objective: This systematic review aims to summarize and describe the numerous intraoperative neuromonitoring techniques available to the skull base surgeon for identification, preservation, and prognostication of facial nerve function during skull base surgery. A systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. Terms related to related to intraoperative neuromonitoring of the facial nerve and the skull base were searched on PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase via Elsevier, and the Web of Science Core Collection via Clarivate databases. Title/abstract and full-text screening was performed by two reviewers. Data on monitoring type, pathology, and surgical approach were collected. The review identified commonly utilized neuromonitoring methods including free-running and stimulated facial nerve electromyography (FEMG), facial corticobulbar motor evoked potentials (FCoMEP), abnormal muscle responses (AMR), and the blink reflex. Less frequently discussed methods were also identified such as the Z-L response. FEMG was the most commonly reported modality, described in 80.50 % of studies, followed by FCoMEPs (25.86 %) and AMR (21.26 %). Each technique demonstrated unique strengths and limitations regarding specificity, sensitivity, and integration into surgical workflow. This systematic review underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary and standardized approach in facial nerve IONM, emphasizing continued collaboration among surgeons, neurophysiologists, and anesthesiologists to enhance patient safety and surgical outcomes.",

METHODS: Cadaver dissection study demonstrating methodology of harvesting the ABMTF. Retrospective chart review of 13 patients from a tertiary rhinology referral center undergoing CSF leak repair using the ABMTF from January 2017 to August 2023. Five cadaveric specimens were utilized to complete the dissection of the ABMTF. Flap dimensions and surface area were measured. A step-by-step surgical technique was recorded to illustrate a video demonstration. Demographic data, BMI, pre and postoperative SNOT 22 scores, size and location of the skull base defect, and flap measurements on computed tomography (CT) were obtained from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Five ABMTF were dissected and showed a mean flap surface area for the medial ABMTF of 3.45 cm2 with a range of 2.5 to 4.46 cm2 and a mean surface area for the lateral ABMTF of 2 cm2. The mean surface area of the flap on CT scan measurements was 3.46 cm2. Twelve patients were female, with an average BMI of 35.1 kg/m2. Ten out of 13 patients were treated post-operatively with acetazolamide for management of presumed intracranial hypertension. Postoperative SNOT 22 scores significantly improved at the last follow up visit. All patients had excellent flap tissue integration at their latest follow up with no postoperative CSF leak. CONCLUSION: The ABMTF is a novel random flap, vascularized by branches of the anterior ethmoid artery, that is effective in skull base reconstruction and CSF leak repair emanating from the anterior skull base between the frontal recess and the posterior ethmoid artery along the ethmoid roof. This flap is versatile with limited morbidity.",

However, this is frequently misdiagnosed as sinusitis, leading to inappropriate antibiotic utilization and unnecessary procedures. We assessed the utility of the 3-Item Identify Migraine (ID Migraine) and the 22-Item Sinonasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22) in differentiating rhinogenic vs. non-rhinogenic facial pain/pressure (NRFP). METHODS: Patients presenting to the rhinology clinic with a complaint of facial pain/pressure completed the ID Migraine and SNOT-22. A diagnosis of CRS or NRFP was given based on imaging criteria. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) were determined to evaluate the ability of the PROMs to identify NRFP. RESULTS: Of the 251 patients enrolled, 114 had CRS and 137 had NRFP. Mean (SD) age was 50 (16), and 69.3% (n = 174) were women. The ID Migraine had a positive predictive value of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.74) and a negative predictive value of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.48 to 0.66), with an AUC of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.58 to 0.71). The SNOT-22 had an AUC of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.58 to 0.71) using the combined five domain scores, with the function domain score having the highest AUC at 0.60 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.67). CONCLUSION: Existing PROMs have limitations when used to identify NRFP in patients presenting with facial pain/pressure. A screening questionnaire developed and validated specifically for this purpose would assist clinicians in early diagnosis and appropriate management of these patients. Given the high incidence of NRFP, this measure could significantly improve healthcare efficiency.",

Authors of this study established the use of a nondestructive laser-based endogenous fluorescence spectroscopy device, \"TumorID,\" to almost immediately classify a specimen as glioma, meningioma, pituitary adenoma, or nonneoplastic tissue in the operating room, utilizing a machine learning algorithm. METHODS: TumorID requires only 0.5 seconds to collect data, without the need for any dyes or tissue manipulation, and utilizes a 100-mW, 405-nm laser that does not damage the tissue. The system was used in the operating room to scan ex vivo specimens from 46 patients (mean age 52 years) with glioma (8 patients), meningioma (10 patients), pituitary adenoma (23 patients), and nonneoplastic tissue resected during an epilepsy operation (5 patients). A support vector machine algorithm was trained to distinguish between these lesions and classify them in near real time. Statistical significance was determined through a generalized estimating equation on the area under the known fluorophore emission regions for free reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), bound NADH, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and neutral porphyrins. RESULTS: Ultimately, the machine learning model showed a high degree of classification power with a multiclass area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.809 ± 0.002. The areas under the curve for neutral porphyrins were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001) and to have the largest impact on model output. CONCLUSIONS: This initial ex vivo clinical study demonstrated the ability of TumorID to rapidly differentiate and classify various pathologies and surrounding brain in a configuration that can be easily translated to scan in vivo. This classification power could allow TumorID to augment surgical decision-making by enabling rapid intraoperative tissue diagnostics and border delineation, potentially improving patient outcomes by allowing for a more informed and complete resection.",

However, real-world data pertaining to tolerability and adverse effects (AE) are lacking. The goal of this study is to investigate AE incidence, timing, and medication discontinuation. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study at a single tertiary care institution. Patients initiating treatment with dupilumab for CRSwNP over a four-year period (2020-2023) with at least six months of follow-up were included. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to investigate relevant clinical factors associated with AEs. Univariate analysis was also performed to determine factors associated with discontinuation due to AEs. RESULTS: 115 patients received at least one dose of dupilumab. Mean age (SD) was 51.0 (14.9) years, and 44% were female. 39 patients reported at least one AE, with 15 having more than one AE. 15 patients (13.0%) discontinued the medication due to an AE. Ocular AEs were the most common (15), followed by injection site reactions (10), musculoskeletal (9), and non-injection site skin reactions (8). Female sex was significantly associated with AEs and discontinuation due to AEs. CONCLUSION: While dupilumab is an effective treatment option for uncontrolled CRSwNP, the incidence of AEs and discontinuation rates were higher than reported in Phase III trials. Additional real-world data pertaining to AEs can aid in clinical decision-making and patient counseling.",

Given its uncommon nature and complex clinical presentation, this comprehensive review highlights recent findings and treatment approaches for advancing clinical practice and research. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature emphasizes significant advancements in the genomic profiling and molecular classification of ONB. Emerging targeted therapies include somatostatin analogs and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors. In addition, the development of genetically engineered mouse models has provided valuable platforms for testing new treatment strategies, revealing similarities between ONB and small cell lung cancer, which may inform future therapeutic approaches. SUMMARY: These findings have profound implications on clinical practice. Improved diagnostic accuracy through advanced imaging and genomic profiling in addition to identifying specific mutations for targeted therapy can lead to personalized treatments of patients with ONB. Developments in genetically engineered mouse models and multiinstitutional collaborative efforts are vital for advancing research and standardizing molecular testing. The integration of advanced imaging techniques, genomic profiling, and targeted therapies holds promise for improving patient outcomes and understanding this rare malignancy.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Many individuals with healthy normal nasal anatomy and function exhibit a prominent notch indentation at the junction of the ala and sidewall, specifically around the anterior-superior region of the unilateral nasal vestibule up to the internal nasal valve. This study evaluates the influence of various sizes of notched indentations at the anterior nasal airway on local airflow pattern. METHODS: A retrospective study involving 25 healthy individuals, each exhibiting at least one unilateral notched indentation (40 total airways). Each individual's notched indentation was quantified after subject-specific three-dimensional nasal airway reconstruction from radiographic images. Computational fluid dynamics modeling was used to simulate nasal inspiratory airflow in each nasal airway at 15 L/min. Localized airflow distributions passing through the inferior, middle, and superior regions were calculated at 15 cross sections. RESULTS: Notched indentation size ranged 1.75-86.84 mm2 (average = 22.37 mm2). At the anterior airway, notched size significantly correlated with inferior airflow volume (R = 0.32, p = 0.04) but not in the middle (R = 0.21, p = 0.20) or superior (R = 0.06, p = 0.70) regions, whereas middle and superior regional resistance values were significantly correlated with notched size (middle: R = 0.54, p < 0.001; superior: R = 0.41, p = 0.009). Medially, resistance at the middle region significantly correlated with notched size (R = 0.56, p < 0.001). At the posterior airway, airflow distributions through the inferior, middle, and superior regions demonstrated weak correlation with notched size (inferior: R = 0.24, p = 0.14, middle: R = 0.24, p = 0.13; superior:R = 0.03, p = 0.83), whereas resistance was significantly correlated in the middle and inferior regions (middle: R = 0.56, p < 0.001;inferior: R = 0.43, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Anterior nasal airway notched indentation size had significantly stronger influence on localized airflow volume through the anterior-inferior airway than other regions of the nasal passage.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort. SETTING: Single tertiary care institution. METHODS: Adults with NRH were recruited over a 2-year period (February 2021 to February 2023). Patients were eligible if they endorsed midfacial pain or pressure for at least 10 days a month over the previous 3 months and had no evidence of rhinosinusitis on both nasal endoscopy and computed tomography imaging. Study participants used a mobile application to keep a daily log of their facial pain/pressure, nasal congestion, and nasal mucus/discharge. Symptom severity was scored on a scale from 1 (none) to 10 (worst) for 30 consecutive days. Repeated measures correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate overall or common intra-individual association for each symptom. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled, and they completed the 30-day symptom log. Median (range) scores were 5 (1-10), 4 (1-10), and 2 (1-10) for facial pain/pressure, congestion, and mucus, respectively. Patients had significant day-to-day fluctuations in scores for all 3 symptoms, with a significant positive correlation between symptoms: congestion/mucus (r = 0.74181, P < .0001), congestion/facial pain (r = 0.5873, P = .001), and mucus/facial pain (r = 0.49384, P = .0076). CONCLUSION: Patients with NRH often have concurrent nasal symptoms. Moreover, nasal congestion, mucus, and facial pain/pressure had significant correlations in day-to-day fluctuations in severity. Our findings suggest the possibility that all three symptoms share a common pathophysiology.",

METHODS: Patients presenting with midfacial pain or pressure to a rhinology clinic were surveyed on how often they utilized common OTC medications, with choices ranging from \"always\" to \"never.\" Patients were categorized into CRS or NRFP groups based on endoscopy and imaging. RESULTS: The study included 251 patients, with 69.3% female and a mean (standard deviation) age of 49.9 (15.7) years. Patients with CRS (n = 114) reported symptom relief \"sometimes\" to \"always\" when using pain relievers (38.6%), intranasal steroids (37.7%), and oral antihistamines (36%). Patients with NRFP (n = 137) responded \"sometimes\" to \"always\" with the use of intranasal steroids (49.6%), decongestants (48.9%), and pain relievers (45.3%). A greater proportion of NRFP patients responded \"sometimes\" to \"always\" for decongestants to relieve symptoms compared to CRS patients (P = .011). There was no significant difference in other OTC medications between groups. CONCLUSION: Patients with midfacial pain or pressure reported using a variety of OTC medications for symptomatic relief. Decongestants were more frequently associated with symptom improvement in patients with NRFP. This finding indicates that symptomatic relief with decongestants may suggest a diagnosis of NRFP.",

Here, we describe a novel lateral based nasopharyngeal flap (LNPF). Two cadaver heads were dissected to elucidate flap anatomy, dimensions, and technique. A retrospective review was performed on two cases where LNPF was used to repair CSF leaks in the nasopharyngeal area, and outcomes reported. The LNPF is an ascending pharyngeal artery myomucosal flap that includes the nasopharyngeal mucosa and the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle. The flap was 1.2 × 2.2 cm in greatest dimensions. The LNPF was used for salvage CSF leak repair in two cases: one clival and one tubal. Both patients had resolution of leak at 7 months follow-up. The LNPF is a novel flap with reconstruction potential for the nasopharynx, including the lower clivus and the eustachian tube.",

We demonstrate that globose basal cells (GBCs) are a permissive cell of origin for ONB and that ONBs exhibit cell fate heterogeneity that mimics normal GBC developmental trajectories. ASCL1 loss in RPM ONB leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. Similar to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONBs exhibit mutually exclusive NEUROD1 and POU2F3-like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral cell fate heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and cell fate plasticity-evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings highlight conserved similarities between ONB and neuroendocrine tumors with significant implications for ONB classification and treatment.",

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective single-institution study. SETTING: Tertiary Care Center Rhinology Clinic. METHODS: All patients presenting with a complaint of facial pain or pressure over a 3-year period were included. Patients were categorized into either NRFP or sinusitis groups based on computed tomography imaging and nasal endoscopy. Data pertaining to demographics, history, and SNOT-22 questionnaire domains were compared via univariate analysis as well as logistic regression with backwards variable selection. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 128 had NRFP and 168 had sinusitis. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the NRFP group were women of childbearing age (40.6% vs 28.0%, P = .02). Backwards variable selection resulted in a model with four variables predicting a diagnosis of NRFP-female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2.998, P < .0001), no history of prior sinonasal surgery (OR = 0.340 for history vs no history, P < .01), low nasal domain score (OR = 0.551, P < .0001), and high ear/facial domain score (OR = 1.453, P < .01). CONCLUSION: Accurately identifying patients with NRFP at initial presentation based on history would help direct patients to the appropriate care pathway and prevent ineffective treatments such as antibiotics and sinus procedures. Our findings suggest that the suspicion for NRFP should be higher in women of child-bearing age as well as patients with greater ear/facial symptoms or lesser nasal symptoms.",

This results in postoperative anosmia that may significantly impact a patient's quality of life without definitive added benefit in survival. The prevalence of occult intracranial disease is low, especially for Hyams grade I and II tumors. A unilateral approach sparing the contralateral cribriform plate and olfactory system can be considered for select cases of early stage, low-grade tumors when the disease does not cross midline to involve the contralateral olfactory cleft or septal mucosa and when midline dural margins can be cleared with frozen pathology. Approximately half of patients who undergo unilateral resection may have residual olfaction even with adjuvant unilateral radiation. Early data suggest favorable disease-free survival and overall survival for patients who underwent the unilateral approach; however, larger sample studies are needed to confirm comparability to bilateral resections regarding oncologic outcomes.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sinusitis is a common diagnosis that can be erroneously associated with routine weather-related barometric pressure changes. In actuality, these pressure changes likely exacerbate migraine headaches, which can cause facial pain and pressure rather than true sinus inflammation. OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to characterize the representation of both sinusitis and migraine in association with barometric pressure changes across websites on the Internet. METHODS: An Internet search for relevant terms was conducted, and content of the resulting pages was assessed for associations between weather-related pressure changes and either sinusitis or migraine. Variations in reported results across different subtypes of Internet sources were analyzed. The primary outcomes measured were (1) whether a given media source associated barometric weather changes with sinusitis, (2) whether that source associated barometric weather changes with migraine, and (3) treatment options offered by that source. RESULTS: Of the 116 included webpages, 36 (31.03%) associated sinusitis and routine barometric pressure changes. Of these, 10 (27.77%) were otolaryngology practice sites. Sixty-seven webpages (57.76%) associated migraine and routine barometric pressure changes. Of these, nonotolaryngology webpages were more likely to report this link. CONCLUSIONS: Otolaryngology practice sites were observed to be the most frequent professional medical resource reporting the unsubstantiated claim that routine barometric pressure changes are associated with sinusitis. Nonotolaryngology sources were more likely to link weather-related pressure changes to migraine. These results suggest that opportunities exist for otolaryngology practice sites to educate patients about nonrhinogenic headache etiologies.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With a rising incidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, endoscopic endonasal CSF leak repair is increasingly performed. Current approaches utilize a variety of materials including free mucosal grafts and vascularized flaps, but post-op leaks continue to be reported. Steroid-eluting bioabsorbable stents (SES) are used during functional endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis to reduce inflammation and scarring while maintaining patency of sinus ostia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of SES as a graft/flap bolster for endoscopic endonasal CSF leak repair. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal CSF leak repair with SES placed as part of the bolster technique at a tertiary care center between January 2019 and May 2022. Age, sex, BMI, comorbid idiopathic intracranial hypertension, pathology, location of CSF leak, intraoperative CSF leak flow, reconstruction type, and presence of post-op CSF leak were recorded. RESULTS: Twelve patients (mean age 52, median BMI 30.9, 58% female) had SES placement as part of the bolster technique. The most common pathology was meningoencephalocele (75%). Reconstruction was performed with either a free mucosal graft (6), or a flap (6). No post-op CSF leaks occurred at a reconstruction site with a stent, and no known complications were reported. All sinusotomies were patent at the last follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: SES placement as an adjunct to graft and/or flap bolster appears to be safe and feasible during anterior skull base reconstruction and CSF leak repair providing longer term structural support and preserving sinus drainage patency.",

However, the consensus for the best embolization practices remains unclear. This systematic review seeks to characterize the reporting of embolization protocols throughout the literature and to compare differences in surgical outcomes. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. REVIEW METHODS: Studies investigating embolization in the treatment of JNA from 2002 to 2021 were selected from defined inclusion criteria. All studies underwent a 2-stage blinded screening, extraction, and appraisal process. Embolization material, time to surgery, and embolization route were compared. Embolization complications, surgical complications, and rate of recurrence were pooled. RESULTS: Of 854 studies, 14 retrospective studies with 415 patients met the criteria for inclusion. A total of 354 patients underwent preoperative embolization. A total of 330 patients (93.2%) underwent transarterial embolization (TAE) and 24 patients had a combination of direct puncture embolization and TAE. Polyvinyl alcohol particles were the most used embolization material (n = 264, 80.0%). The most common reported time to surgery was 24 to 48 hours (n = 8, 57.1%). Pooled results showed an embolization complication proportion of 3.16% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-6.60) (n = 354), a surgical complication proportion of 4.96% (95% CI: 1.90-9.37) (n = 415), and a recurrence proportion of 6.30% (95% CI: 3.01-10.69) (n = 415). CONCLUSION: The current data on JNA embolization parameters and their effect on surgical outcomes remains too heterogenous to provide expert recommendations. Future studies should use uniform reporting to allow for more robust comparisons of embolization parameters, which, in turn, may lead to optimized patient outcomes.",

Because of the low incidence of this tumor, as well as an absence of established cell lines and murine models, understanding the mechanisms driving olfactory neuroblastoma pathobiology has been challenging. Here, we sought to apply advances from research on the human olfactory epithelial neurogenic niche, along with new biocomputational approaches, to better understand the cellular and molecular factors in low- and high-grade olfactory neuroblastoma and how specific transcriptomic markers may predict prognosis. We analyzed a total of 19 olfactory neuroblastoma samples with available bulk RNA-sequencing and survival data, along with 10 samples from normal olfactory epithelium. A bulk RNA-sequencing deconvolution model identified a significant increase in globose basal cell (GBC) and CD8 T-cell identities in high-grade tumors (GBC from ∼0% to 8%, CD8 T cell from 0.7% to 2.2%), and significant decreases in mature neuronal, Bowman's gland, and olfactory ensheathing programs, in high-grade tumors (mature neuronal from 3.7% to ∼0%, Bowman's gland from 18.6% to 10.5%, olfactory ensheathing from 3.4% to 1.1%). Trajectory analysis identified potential regulatory pathways in proliferative olfactory neuroblastoma cells, including PRC2, which was validated by immunofluorescence staining. Survival analysis guided by gene expression in bulk RNA-sequencing data identified favorable prognostic markers such as SOX9, S100B, and PLP1 expression. SIGNIFICANCE: Our analyses provide a basis for additional research on olfactory neuroblastoma management, as well as identification of potential new prognostic markers.",

METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for NCSCC from 2004 to 2014. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment regimen were compared for the entire cohort. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for statistical analysis of treatment regimen and surgical margins on overall survival (OS) for early and late-stage disease. RESULTS: A total of 1883 NCSCC patients were identified. The OS for the cohort was 83 months, and median age at diagnosis was 65 years. NCSCC patients who underwent surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) had a better OS compared to definitive RT (HR: 0.58, P < .001). In early stage NCSCC (T1/T2, N0), there was no significant difference in OS between patients treated with surgery only or surgery with adjuvant RT compared to definitive RT. In advanced stage NCSCC, surgery with adjuvant RT had a better OS compared to definitive chemoradiation. Having positive margins was shown to predict a worse OS when compared to negative margins in surgical patients despite adjuvant RT or chemoradiation. CONCLUSIONS: NCSCC appears to be best treated with surgery followed by adjuvant RT in advanced-stage disease whereas in early-stage disease, surgery does not improve OS compared to definitive RT.",

Objective: To investigate the etiology of uCLND-associated olfactory dysfunction using clinical, computational, and histologic assessments. Methods: Inclusion criteria: uCLND patients >16 years undergoing septorhinoplasty. Exclusion criteria: prior septoplasty or rhinoplasty, pregnancy, sinusitis. Measured outcomes: patient-reported scores, rhinomanometry, smell identification and threshold tests, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) airflow simulations, and histologic analysis of olfactory epithelium. Results: Five uCLND subjects were included: 18-23 years, three male and two female, four left-sided cleft and one right-sided cleft. All subjects reported moderate to severe nasal obstruction. Smell identification and threshold tests showed varying degrees of hyposmia. Nasal resistance was higher on the cleft side versus noncleft side measured by rhinomanometry (median 3.85 Pa-s/mL, interquartile range [IQR] = 21.96, versus 0.90 Pa-s/mL, IQR = 5.17) and CFD (median 1.04 Pa-s/mL, IQR = 0.94 vs. 0.11 Pa-s/mL, IQR = 0.12). Unilateral olfaction varied widely and was dependent on unilateral percentage olfactory airflow. Biopsies revealed intact olfactory neuroepithelium. Conclusions: uCLND-associated olfactory dysfunction appears to be primarily conductive in etiology and highly susceptible to variations in nasal anatomy.

Although these alterations are often transient, many patients with COVID-19 exhibit olfactory dysfunction that lasts months to years. Although animal and human autopsy studies have suggested mechanisms driving acute anosmia, it remains unclear how SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent smell loss in a subset of patients. To address this question, we analyzed olfactory epithelial samples collected from 24 biopsies, including from nine patients with objectively quantified long-term smell loss after COVID-19. This biopsy-based approach revealed a diffuse infiltrate of T cells expressing interferon-γ and a shift in myeloid cell population composition, including enrichment of CD207+ dendritic cells and depletion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA or protein, gene expression in the barrier supporting cells of the olfactory epithelium, termed sustentacular cells, appeared to reflect a response to ongoing inflammatory signaling, which was accompanied by a reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons relative to olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells. These findings indicate that T cell-mediated inflammation persists in the olfactory epithelium long after SARS-CoV-2 has been eliminated from the tissue, suggesting a mechanism for long-term post-COVID-19 smell loss.",

Methods  We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of shared quality data points for the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) for pituitary adenomas, along with other sellar and parasellar region masses that were included by participating institutions. Patient and operative characteristics, perioperative and postoperative antibiotic regimens and their durations, intraoperative and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak, and onset of postoperative meningitis and sinusitis were compared. Results  Fifteen institutions participated and provided 6 consecutive months' worth of case data. Five hundred ninety-three cases were included in the study, of which 564 were pituitary adenomectomies. The incidences of postoperative meningitis and sinusitis were low (0.67 and 2.87% for all pathologies, respectively; 0.35% meningitis for pituitary adenomas) and did not correlate with any specific antibiotic regimen. Immunocompromised status posed an increased odds of meningitis in pituitary adenomectomies (28.6, 95% confidence interval [1.72-474.4]).

It is unclear whether older patients with significant medical comorbidities experience similar benefits. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether increasing medical comorbidity is associated with worse sinonasal quality of life outcomes after ESS in older patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of CRS patients 55 years or older who underwent elective ESS at an academic institution from July 2017 to June 2019. 22-Item Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22) scores were gathered at baseline as well as at 3 and 6 months following surgery. Data on demographics, medical comorbidities, preoperative Lund-Mackay (LM) scores, and postoperative complications were extracted from the medical record. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated for each patient. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate a potential association between CCI and change in SNOT-22 scores at 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 205 patients met inclusion criteria with a mean (SD) CCI score of 2 (2.4) and a CCI score range of 0 to 11. The mean (SD) LM score was 8 (5.3). Rates of asthma and nasal polyposis were 28.3% and 36.6%, respectively. The mean (SD) improvement in SNOT-22 scores at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline was 17.9 (19.7) and 20.9 (18.1) points, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, there was no significant association between CCI and change in SNOT-22 scores. CONCLUSION: Greater medical comorbidity is not associated with worse SNOT-22 outcomes postoperatively, although future studies are needed to determine if comorbidities are associated with higher complication rates. A multidisciplinary approach to perioperative care is critical in maintaining the safety and efficacy of ESS in this patient population.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify clinical and demographic factors that may influence sinonasal and pulmonary outcomes after surgery. METHODS: This is a six-year retrospective analysis of adult cystic fibrosis patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery at a tertiary care center. 22-Item Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test scores and mean forced expiratory volume data at baseline and three to six months after surgery were analyzed using t-test and stepwise regression with the following covariates: age, gender, lung transplant, revision surgery, and pseudomonas on sinus culture. RESULTS: 119 surgeries were performed on 88 patients, with 69% on patients with transplant. The overall mean (Standard Deviation) improvement in 22-Item Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test score was 9.42 (18.15) for the entire cohort (P < .001). Pseudomonas on culture was associated with less improvement in sinonasal scores (P = .002). There was no significant change in forced expiratory volume after surgery (P = .94). Revision surgery (P = .004) and older age (P = .007) were associated with less favorable change of pulmonary function on stepwise regression (P = .002). There was no correlation between change in sinonasal scores and pulmonary function. CONCLUSION: Although surgery was associated with a clinically and statistically significant improvement in sinonasal scores in cystic fibrosis patients, patients with pseudomonas may experience less benefit. Revision surgery and older age may be associated with less favorable pulmonary outcomes. Awareness of such variables may help when deciding which cystic fibrosis patients should undergo surgery.",

The olfactory epithelium (OE) is the peripheral organ for olfaction and is subject to acquired damage, suggesting a likely site of pathology in aging. Adult stem cells reconstitute the neuroepithelium in response to cell loss under normal conditions. In aged OE, patches of respiratory-like metaplasia have been observed histologically, consistent with a failure in normal neuroepithelial homeostasis.MethodsAccordingly, we have focused on identifying cellular and molecular changes in presbyosmic OE. The study combined psychophysical testing with olfactory mucosa biopsy analysis, single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq), and culture studies.ResultsWe identified evidence for inflammation-associated changes in the OE stem cells of presbyosmic patients. The presbyosmic basal stem cells exhibited increased expression of genes involved in response to cytokines or stress or the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. Using a culture model, we found that cytokine exposure drove increased TP63, a transcription factor acting to prevent OE stem cell differentiation.ConclusionsOur data suggest aging-related inflammatory changes in OE stem cells may contribute to presbyosmia via the disruption of normal epithelial homeostasis.

In addition, a review of the literature points to certain clinical features that may allow for the identification of nonrhinogenic headache based on history.

Frontal sinusotomy is the most challenging part of ESS, with one of the key outcomes being access for topical irrigations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare irrigation penetration into the frontal sinus following Draf IIa versus modified Draf IIa frontal sinusotomy. METHODS: Four fresh cadaver heads were used in this experiment. Draf IIa was performed on one side of each head and a modified Draf IIa on the contralateral side. This proposed modification consists of a Draf IIa combined with an agger nasi punch-out procedure and partial trimming of the vertical lamella of the middle turbinate back to the posterior table of the frontal sinus without drilling the beak. Each head was irrigated with methylene blue-dyed water and recorded by rigid endoscopy through an endonasal view (EV) of the frontal sinus and frontal trephination view (TV). Two blinded rhinologists scored the extent of staining (using an ordinal scale of 0 to 3) for each side. A case report where the modified Draf IIa was performed is also described. RESULTS: After modified Draf IIa sinuosotomy, the mean score for the EV was 2.125 and for the TV was 2, versus 0.875 and 0.625 for traditional Draf IIa, respectively. There was a statistically significant increase for both EV (p = 0.019) and TV (p = 0.018) after modified Draf IIa. CONCLUSION: In our cadaveric model, this procedural modification improved penetration of postoperative irrigations into the frontal sinus. This simple technique may be easily adapted into frontal ESS when indicated.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common and costly health problem in the United States. While often associated with younger adults, CRS can affect the elderly. As the aging population increases in the United States, the cost burden of CRS in older adults is important to assess. The objective of this study is to characterize healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and healthcare expenditure (HCE) for CRS in this population. METHODS: Patients meeting criteria for CRS with three years of continuous data were identified on IBM® Marketscan Research Databases over a five-year period (2013-2017). Medication utilization, outpatient visits, surgery, and expenditures related to CRS were assessed for older adults (>65) and compared with other age groups. As a secondary analysis, multivariable generalized linear models were utilized to compare HCE while adjusting for baseline medication utilization. RESULTS: A total of 238,825 patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 20,927 were older adults. Older adults had the highest overall prevalence of nasal polyps (10%) and asthma (16%) among adult groups. Surgery rate was lower than other adult groups, but medication utilization was the highest. Mean overall HCE at two years was highest in older adults (USD 2545 vs. 2298 in young adults). However, HCE was highest for the young adult group after adjusting for baseline medication usage. CONCLUSION: Older adults had a higher rate of CRS-related co-morbidities as well as the highest CRS-related medication utilization and unadjusted two-year HCE. Although the reasons for this are unclear, possibilities include greater disease severity and preference for medical versus surgical management. HCE for CRS is expected to increase as the aging population grows.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to cigarette smoke has been associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications across a variety of surgical specialties. However, it is unclear if smoking increases this risk after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Because complication rates after ESS are relatively low, a large national database allows for a statistically meaningful study of this topic. METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) dataset from 2005 to 2016 was analyzed. Patients who underwent ESS were identified. Thirty-day postoperative complication rates between smokers and nonsmokers were compared. Complications included infection, thromboembolic events, reintubation, readmission, acute renal failure, and cardiovascular events. RESULTS: 921 patients who underwent ESS were identified. 182 (20%) were smokers and 739 (80%) were nonsmokers. 609 patients underwent outpatient ESS, while 312 patients underwent inpatient ESS. A total of 12 patients experienced postoperative surgical site infections involving the deeper tissues beyond the wound (organ/space SSI). On univariate analysis, smoking was associated with a higher incidence of organ/space SSI (P = .0067) and pulmonary embolism (P = .0321) after ESS. On multivariate logistic regression, smoking was associated with increased odds (4.495, 1.11- 8.17, P = .0347) of organ/space SSI after ESS. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates an association between exposure to cigarette smoke and potentially serious surgical site infections in the 30-day postoperative period after ESS. Our findings may help when counseling smokers who are considering ESS. Further study is required to understand the nature of these infections and ways to prevent them.Level of Evidence: 2c (\"health outcomes\").",

Our goal is to analyze treatment outcomes in poorly differentiated SCC (PDSCC) using a large national database. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database study. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for sinonasal invasive SCC, grade 3 (poorly differentiated) from 2004 to 2014. Patient demographics and tumor and treatment characteristics were tabulated. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis was performed to compare overall survival (OS) between histology subtype and primary site. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for statistical analysis of treatment regimen on OS. RESULTS: A total of 1,074 patients were identified. The maxillary sinus was the most common site (45%). T4 tumors were observed in 50% of patients, with most patients treated at high-volume facilities (77%). In KM analysis, spindle cell SCC histological subtype, primary tumors of the maxillary sinus, and poorly differentiated grade had worse OS. In our Cox-PH model, higher T stage and age were associated with worse OS. Those treated at a high-volume facility and those who underwent surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation had improved OS. Chemotherapy within the treatment regimen did not confer survival benefit except in surgical patients when positive margins were present, and surgery with adjuvant chemoradiation trended toward improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: Sinonasal PDSCC appears to be best treated at high-volume centers with surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation. Poorly differentiated grade has worse OS compared to more differentiated tumors. Chemotherapy along with adjuvant radiation may have a role in patients with positive surgical margins.

Treatment and sequence of therapies are still unclear. The goal of this study is to analyze treatment outcomes in SCND using a national database. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for SCND from 2004 to 2014. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics and treatment paradigms were tabulated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for statistical analysis of treatment regimen on overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 415 patients were identified. Most patients were male (61.2%), with a median age of 58 years and the most common primary site was the nasal cavity (52.5%). T4 tumors were observed in 67.7% of cases. Unimodality (41.9%) and bimodality (43.9%) therapies were the most common treatment modalities. Radiation therapy was the only treatment administered in 30% of the patients, while 27.2% received definitive chemoradiation (CRT) and 11.6% had surgery with adjuvant CRT. In our Cox-PH model, age (HR = 1.04, p < 0.001), T4 (HR = 2.6, p = 0.004) and N2/N3 (HR = 2.18, p = 0.001) were associated with worse survival. Trimodality (HR = 0.49, p = 0.005) and bimodality (HR = 0.65, p = 0.009) therapies had a better OS compared to unimodality. Patients treated with definitive CRT or surgery with adjuvant CRT had a significant increase in OS (p = 0.01 and 0.002 respectively). CONCLUSION: SCND appears to be best treated using a multimodality approach with definitive CRT or surgery followed by CRT. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could be helpful in selecting the best treatment strategy.",

METHODS: A leadership course was introduced within the Department of Head and Neck Surgery & Communication Sciences at Duke University Medical Center. A 360 evaluation assessing domains of the professional intelligence model was recorded for all participants. Participant demographics included gender (male vs female), generation group (generation Y vs older generations) and physician status of participants (physician vs non-physician). Differences in mean self-scores were modeled using linear regression. When analyzing the evaluator scores, gaps were defined as self-score minus evaluator-score for each member of a participant's evaluator groupings (supervisor, peer, and direct report). Two types of linear mixed models were fit with a random intercept to account for the correlated gaps in the same participant. RESULTS: Scores of 50 participants and 394 evaluators were analyzed. The average age was 40.6 (standard deviation 9.3) years, and 50% (N=25) of participants were females. Physicians accounted for 36% (N=18) of the cohort, and 61% (N=11) of physicians were residents. Physicians scored themselves lower than non-physicians when assessing leadership intelligence, interpersonal relations, empathy, and focused thinking. On average, participants under-rated themselves compared to their evaluators with direct reports giving higher scores than managers and peers. When compared with generation Y, older generations tended to rate themselves lower than their peers and managers in cognitive intelligence. No significant association was observed between gender and any scores. CONCLUSION: Participants rate themselves lower on average than their evaluators. This work is important in understanding how perceived leadership qualities are assessed and developed within an academic surgical department. Finally, the results presented could serve as a model to address the gap between self- and other-perceptions of defined leadership virtues in future leadership development activities.",

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 36 patients undergoing EESBS for lesions limited to the sella were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following were performed before and three months after surgery: 22-Item Sinonasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22), University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), and the Assessment of Self-reported Olfactory Functioning (ASOF), which has three domains: subjective olfactory capability scale (SOC), smell-related problems (SRP), and olfactory-related quality of life (ORQ). RESULTS: Median age at surgery was 52.5 years, with a median tumor size of 1.8 cm (range: 0.2 to 3.9 cm). Pre- and postoperative median scores were 35 [34, 36.2] and 34.5 [32, 36] for UPSIT, 21 [7.5, 33.5] and 21.5 [6.8, 35.7] for SNOT-22, 10 [9, 10] and 9 [8, 10] for ASOF-SOC, 5 [4.8, 5] and 4.5 [4, 5] for ASOF-SRP, and 5 [5, 5] and 5 [4.5, 5] for ASOF-ORQ. There was no significant change in the two of the three domains of the ASOF. Correlation between ASOF and UPSIT scores were weak. Older age and larger tumor size were associated with worsened olfaction after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients did not experience significant changes in olfactory-specific QOL three months after EESBS, as measured by two domains of the ASOF. The ASOF may serve as a useful adjunctive tool for assessing olfaction after surgery. The lack of correlation between UPSIT and ASOF suggests the need for more research in subjective olfactory-related quality of life after surgery.",

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database analysis. SETTING: National Cancer Database (2004-2014). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for sinonasal SCC from 2004 to 2014. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics and classification, resection margins, treatment regimen, and facility case-specific volume-averaged per year and grouped in tertiles as low (0%-33%), medium (34%-66%), and high (67%-100%)-were compared. Overall survival was compared with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3835 patients treated for sinonasal SCC between 2004 and 2014 were identified. Therapeutic options included surgery alone (18.6%), radiotherapy (RT) alone (29.1%), definitive chemoradiation (15.4%), surgery with adjuvant RT (22.8%), and combinations (14.1%) of the aforementioned treatments. Patients who underwent surgery with adjuvant RT had better overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; P < .001; 95% CI, 0.63-0.86). As for treatment volume per facility, 7.4% of patients were treated at a low-volume center, 17.5% at a medium-volume center, and 75.1% at a high-volume center. Univariate analysis showed that treatment at a high-volume facility conferred a significantly better overall survival (HR, 0.77; P = .002). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, tumor classification, and treatment regimen, demonstrated that patients who underwent treatment at a high-volume facility (HR, 0.81; P < .001) had significantly improved survival. CONCLUSION: This study shows a better overall survival for sinonasal SCC treated at high-volume centers. Further study may be needed to understand the effect of case volume on the paradigms of sinonasal SCC management.",

However, the use of BSD specifically in revision sinus surgery has not been investigated. This study addresses the question of how BSD is utilized as a tool in revision sinus surgery. METHODS: Data from MarketScan (Truven Health) over a 5-year period (2012-2016) were analyzed. Patients who underwent a sinus procedure with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up were included. RESULTS: A total of 62,304 patients met inclusion criteria; 6847 (10.99%) underwent revision. Age >55 years, the South geographical region, and medical comorbidities increased the odds of revision on multivariate analysis. For patients undergoing revision, BSD was used 11%, 21%, and 13% of the time for revisions of the maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses, respectively. For a sinus that underwent revision after an initial BSD, a repeat BSD was done close to 40% of the time. CONCLUSION: BSD is used frequently in the revision setting, especially for the frontal sinus and for patients who had already undergone an initial BSD. Our findings highlight the prevalent role of BSD in revision surgery and the need to evaluate such practices.",

A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are common complications in older adults associated with increased 1-year mortality and long-term cognitive decline. One risk factor for worsened long-term postoperative cognitive trajectory is the Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk factor APOE4. APOE4 is thought to elevate AD risk partly by increasing neuroinflammation, which is also a theorized mechanism for PND. Yet, it is unclear whether modulating apoE4 protein signaling in older surgical patients would reduce PND risk or severity. OBJECTIVE: MARBLE is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled phase II sequential dose escalation trial designed to evaluate perioperative administration of an apoE mimetic peptide drug, CN-105, in older adults (age≥60 years). The primary aim is evaluating the safety of CN-105 administration, as measured by adverse event rates in CN-105 versus placebo-treated patients. Secondary aims include assessing perioperative CN-105 administration feasibility and its efficacy for reducing postoperative neuroinflammation and PND severity. METHODS: 201 patients undergoing non-cardiac, non-neurological surgery will be randomized to control or CN-105 treatment groups and receive placebo or drug before and every six hours after surgery, for up to three days after surgery. Chart reviews, pre- and postoperative cognitive testing, delirium screening, and blood and CSF analyses will be performed to examine effects of CN-105 on perioperative adverse event rates, cognition, and neuroinflammation. Trial results will be disseminated by presentations at conferences and peer-reviewed publications. CONCLUSION: MARBLE is a transdisciplinary study designed to measure CN-105 safety and efficacy for preventing PND in older adults and to provide insight into the pathogenesis of these geriatric syndromes.",

This study analyzes symptom profiles of such patients to help identify those who may benefit from polysomnography. METHODS: This is a 2-year retrospective analysis of adult patients at an academic practice with a rhinologic chief complaint. Results of the 22-Item Sinonasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22) were compared between patients with untreated OSA without CRS (OSA group) and a control group of CRS patients (CRS group). Univariate analysis with Bonferroni correction and multiple logistic regression were used. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the OSA group (mean apnea-hypopnea index = 28.8, SD = 21.0) and 124 patients in the CRS group. CRS group demonstrated higher scores in nasal, extra-nasal, and ear/facial symptom domains (P < .001), while OSA group displayed higher psychological (P = .020) and sleep domain scores (P = .048). Nasal discharge (P < .001) and loss of smell/taste (P = .004) scores were higher in CRS group, whereas facial pain (P = .285) and nasal obstruction (P = .822) were not significantly different. On logistic regression, thick nasal discharge, loss of smell/taste, and ear pain were predictive of CRS, while waking up tired was predictive of OSA. Finally, OSA group was more likely to choose a sleep-related issue as a most important symptom (MIS) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: OSA and CRS have significant overlap in symptom profiles. The SNOT-22 can help identify those with undiagnosed OSA. OSA should be suspected in patients who report a sleep-related item as a MIS and display higher psychological and sleep domain scores.",

RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were stratified into three groups based on number of opioid tablets taken during the first week after surgery: 31 patients (23%) took no opioids, 61 patients (45%) took one to five tablets, and 44 patients (32%) took more than five tablets. Gender, extent of surgery, revision surgery, polyp status, and cystic fibrosis did not significantly vary between the three groups. Multinomial logistic regression analysis with backward stepwise variable selection method revealed that those who had septoplasty (odds ratio [OR]: 4.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68-13.98; P < .01) or were of younger age (OR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.99; P = .01) had significantly higher odds of taking >5 tablets. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients undergoing FESS did not take more than 5 opioid tablets after surgery. Concurrent septoplasty and younger age were associated with increased opioid usage. Knowledge of such factors can help surgeons to assess opioid prescribing patterns and to counsel their patients on postoperative pain. Laryngoscope, 129:1751-1755, 2019.",

However, there is limited data available on quality of life (QOL) outcomes following EESBS. Methods  A retrospective review of patients undergoing EESBS from January 2014 to April 2017 was performed. Records were reviewed for clinical history, operative details, and 22-item Sinonasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22) scores. Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models were utilized to compare change in SNOT-22 scores from baseline in patients who underwent a simple sella approach (SA) or an extended beyond sella approach (BSA). Results  A total of 108 patients were in the SA group, while 61 patients were in the BSA group. SNOT-22 scores were available at baseline and 3 months for 84 patients, while 6-month scores were available for 49 patients. SNOT-22 scores for all patients were not significantly different at 3 months ( p  = 0.40) or at 6 months ( p  = 0.58). Unadjusted linear regression model did not show an association between the type of approach and change in SNOT-22 score at 3 months ( p  = 0.07) and 6 months ( p  = 0.28). Adjusted regression model showed a significant decrease in SNOT-22 scores at 3 months ( p  = 0.04) for the BSA group, but there was no significant change in SNOT-22 score at 6 months ( p  = 0.22). Conclusion  Patients undergoing EESBS had no significant change in outcomes at 3 and 6 months. A more extensive BSA was not associated with worse QOL outcomes as measured by SNOT-22.",

The objective of this study is to investigate factors that may be associated with BSP failure. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Academic center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This is a 6-year (July 2011-June 2017) retrospective review of patients who underwent BSP or revision endoscopic sinus surgery (rESS) after BSP within a single tertiary health system. Demographics, clinical findings, and radiographic findings were investigated for association with rESS via univariate analyses and a multivariable backward elimination selection procedure. RESULTS: A total of 154 patients were identified (median age, 53 years): 146 patients underwent BSP at a single health system, with 16 (11%) undergoing rESS; 8 patients underwent BSP at an outside institution and underwent rESS with the senior author. Mean ± SD follow-up was 12.8 ± 16.6 months. Univariate analyses revealed that prior endoscopic sinus surgery, polyps, allergic rhinitis, and gram-negative infection were significantly associated with rESS. As for radiographic findings, a higher Lund-Mackay score, neo-osteogenesis, moderate or complete opacification, and hyperdensities were associated with rESS. The final model after multivariable selection showed that higher radiographic scores (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17) and neo-osteogenesis (odds ratio, 5.25; 95% CI, 1.68-16.42) were associated with higher odds for rESS. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies several clinical and radiographic factors that may be associated with the need for rESS after BSP. Surgeons can take these factors into consideration when deciding whether a patient should forego BSP and undergo conventional FESS.",

Despite being rare, these tumors include a wide spectrum of histological subtypes with different biological behaviors. Choosing the optimal treatment modalities and analyzing the different oncological outcomes is therefore challenging. This study aims to evaluate the role of induction chemotherapy prior to definitive local therapy for sinonasal malignancies. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted. With the assistance of a medical librarian, data sources including MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, NCBI Bookshelf, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched using a customized search strategy that yielded 1758 articles. Inclusion criteria used were as follows: (1) the study has a patient population with 3 or more patients with previously untreated sinonasal malignancies; (2) patients underwent induction chemotherapy prior to definitive local therapy; (3) pretreatment staging information was documented; (4) overall survival was reported by histology type either in table or Kaplan-Meier format. Nine studies with 220 patients ultimately met inclusion criteria and were analyzed in groups based on tumor histology. RESULTS: For squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the 5-year overall survival was 51%. For neuroendocrine tumors, the 5-year overall survival was 78%. Eighteen percent (18%) of patients with pretreatment orbital involvement ultimately underwent orbital exenteration. CONCLUSION: Induction chemotherapy in the management of sinonasal malignancies has similar overall survival outcomes as other standard treatment modalities and can be offered as an option to patients as part of multimodality therapy.",

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Academic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) undergoing BCD and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) from 2011 to 2014 were identified in Truven Health MarketScan Databases with codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition. Prevalence of CRS and frequency of sinus procedures were trended over the study period. Information related to site of service, demographics, and comorbidities was analyzed. RESULTS: Although the prevalence of CRS and sinus procedures remained stable over the study period, there was a consistent increase in the annual number of BCD procedures performed in the office. Among BCD procedures, multisinus dilation had the largest increase. A higher proportion of patients undergoing BCD were women, aged ≥65 years, and from the South. There was a higher prevalence of headache disorder and allergic rhinitis in the BCD group, as compared with the FESS and hybrid groups. CONCLUSION: BCD, especially in the office, has risen in popularity since the introduction of Current Procedural Terminology codes in 2011. This study reveals significant differences in demographics and comorbidities between patients undergoing BCD and those undergoing FESS. Such disparities may highlight the need for better-defined indications for use of this technology.",

Additionally, the authors review the only 2 similar cases within the literature and describe the common clinical features, radiographic findings, and pathologic characteristics of this exceptionally rare disease process. METHODS:: Chart review for single patient, review of literature. RESULTS:: The patient presented with bilateral nasal obstruction. Computed tomography revealed a left sinonasal mass with skull base hyperostosis, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed a concomitant olfactory groove meningioma. Examination showed a bilateral, completely obstructing sinonasal mass with skip areas, and biopsy confirmed inverted papilloma (human papilloma virus strains 16 and 18 indeterminate). The patient underwent bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery, left medial maxillectomy, and left partial nasopharyngectomy. Given her multifocal disease, she was advised that she would require additional excision, but was lost to follow up. One year later she developed acute left facial paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an enhancing mass in the left mastoid with enhancement along the Eustachian tube in addition to her known recurrent sinonasal disease. Simultaneous endoscopic sinus surgery and mastoidectomy were performed. Polypoid tissue was removed from the nasopharynx, mesotympanum, epitympanum, and retrofacial air cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that cells stained positive for p63 and dermCK and negative for synaptophysin. Morphologically, cells were bland, without classic stromal invasion, retaining their smooth, cystic, and papillary features, despite their increased depth within the tissue. Upon further review and consultation with an outside pathologist, a diagnosis of low-grade papillary Schneiderian carcinoma was made. The patient was referred for radiation therapy and is disease free at 3-month follow-up, with return of her facial function. CONCLUSIONS:: This case represents the first report of concurrent low-grade papillary Schneiderian carcinoma of both the nasal cavity and mastoid. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing this new entity through pathologic analysis and suspecting it when the clinical course does not follow an expected pattern.",

Additionally, these patients develop acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) due to these devices. Management is complicated by the risk of thrombosis if anticoagulation is reversed. This study sought to characterize the clinical features and management of epistaxis in this high-risk population. METHODS: Retrospective review of adults with VAD and epistaxis necessitating inpatient consultation with the otolaryngology service were included. RESULTS: 49 patients met inclusion criteria. All patients had a presumed diagnosis of AvWS. An elevated INR (> 2.0) was present in 18 patients (36.7%). Anticoagulation was held in 14 (28.6%) patients, though active correction was not necessary. Multiple encounters were required in 16 (32.7%) patients. Spontaneous epistaxis was associated with multiple encounters (p = 0.02). The use of hemostatic material was associated with a lower likelihood of bleeding recurrence (p = 0.05), whereas cauterization with silver nitrate alone was associated with a higher likelihood of re-intervention (p = 0.05). Surgery or embolization was not required urgently for any patient. Endoscopy under general anesthesia was performed for one patient electively. Mean follow up time was 16.6 months (σ = 6.3). At six months, 18 (36.7%) patients were deceased. CONCLUSION: While these patients are at risk for recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, nonsurgical treatment without active correction of INR or AvWS was largely successful. Placement of hemostatic material, as opposed to cautery with silver nitrate, should be considered as a first-line treatment in this group. Multidisciplinary collaboration is critical for successful management.",

BACKGROUND: Biofilms play a major role in recalcitrant otitis media and are challenging to treat. Many therapeutic strategies have been attempted and the role of topical therapies is still being investigated. Topical irrigation using saline or 1% baby shampoo and the use of a hydrodebrider have been investigated in biofilms involved in chronic rhinosinusitis and their role within the middle ear is yet to be determined. METHODS: Twenty-two adult chinchillas underwent bilateral trans-bullar inoculation of non-typable biofilm forming Haemophilus influenza followed by unilateral middle ear irrigation 5 days later using saline administered via a powered hydrodebrider or manual irrigation of saline or 1% baby shampoo. Contralateral inoculated ears served as control and were not irrigated. Two days following irrigation, the bullae were harvested and processed for scanning electron microscopy to assess biofilm surface area. Auditory brainstem responses were performed before bacterial inoculation and prior to euthanasia. RESULTS: Manual and powered irrigation were effective in reducing the surface area of biofilm when compared to the control group. The hydrodebrider demonstrated to be more effective at eradicating biofilm than manual irrigation, especially in areas of difficult access, such as the ventral portion of the chinchillas' bullae. There was no difference in manual irrigation of saline when compared to 1% baby shampoo. Irrigations either manually or using the hydrodebrider did not affect hearing, the vestibular system or facial function. CONCLUSION: Middle ear biofilms can be treated safely and effectively with rinses using either normal saline or 1% baby shampoo administered manually or with a powered hydrodebrider.

RESULTS: The success rate of free tissue transfer was 100%. Complete separation of the intracranial and sinonasal cavities was achieved in all patients; thus, resolving the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage in all patients. The VLFTT was inset through a minimally invasive approach utilizing an anterior maxillotomy via a gingivobuccal incision, an endoscopic medial maxillectomy, and endoscopic inset in all patients.

However, infection of the transplanted lungs can lead to serious complications, including graft failure and death. Although many of these patients have concurrent sinusitis, it is unclear whether bacteria from the sinuses can infect the allograft. METHODS: This is a single-institution retrospective study of all patients who underwent lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis from 2005 to 2015 at Duke University Hospital. Pre- and posttransplant nasal and pulmonary cultures obtained via nasal endoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), respectively, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 141 patients underwent 144 lung transplants. Sinus cultures were available for 76 patients (12 pretransplant, 42 posttransplant, 22 both pre- and posttransplant). Pretransplant BAL cultures were available for 139 patients, and posttransplant BAL cultures were available for all patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were the most common organisms cultured. There was a significant correlation between pretransplant sinus and posttransplant BAL cultures for PsA (p = 0.003), MRSA (p = 0.013), and Burkholderia cepacia (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: There was a high correlation between pretransplant sinus cultures and posttransplant BAL cultures for PsA, MRSA, and Burkholderia sp. This suggests that the paranasal sinuses may act as a reservoir for allograft colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis. Further studies are needed to determine whether treatment of sinusitis affects allograft colonization and transplant outcomes.",

However, repair of larger defects with high-flow cerebrospinal fluid leakage, or of defects in the petroclival area, is more challenging and often requires a local or regional pedicled vascularized graft.

This study aims to identify objective computed tomography (CT) characteristics in RARS. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Tertiary academic medical center. Subjects and Methods Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for RARS were identified retrospectively from the senior author's practice. Patients were diagnosed with RARS if they experienced 3 or more episodes of acute sinusitis within the past year with complete resolution of symptoms in between episodes. At least 1 episode was confirmed via CT or endoscopy. CT scans showing prior surgery were excluded. The scans for these patients were compared with those from a normal control group. Bone radiodensity of the entire ostiomeatal complex (OMC), including the ethmoid bulla, middle turbinate, and uncinate, was measured in Hounsfield units. Maximum radiodensity was noted for each side. Results A total of 16 patients meeting inclusion criteria for RARS were compared with 16 healthy patients. The mean Lund-MacKay score was 1.6 in the RARS group and 1.3 in the control group. The maximum radiodensity of the OMC was significantly higher in the RARS group (556) compared with that of the control group (327) ( P < .0001). Conclusion Patients with RARS had significantly greater radiodensity of the OMC compared with those in the control group despite minimal differences in mucosal disease. Radiodensity measurement of the OMC using Hounsfield units may help to identify patients with this elusive diagnosis.",

CLINICAL REPORT: A 51-year-old man, presented with left periorbital and retro-orbital pain associated with left nasal obstruction. An initial computed tomographic (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses failed to reveal any significant abnormality. A subsequent CT scan, indicated for recurrence of symptoms 11 months later, showed significant maxillary atelectasis. An uncinectomy, maxillary antrostomy, and anterior ethmoidectomy resulted in a complete resolution of the symptoms. CONCLUSION: Chronic maxillary atelectasis is most commonly a consequence of chronic rhinosinusitis. All previous reports have indicated a chronic process but lacked documentation of the course of the disease. This report documents a patient of rapidly progressive chronic maxillary atelectasis with CT scans that demonstrate changes in the maxillary sinus (from normal to atelectatic) within 11 months.",

                  "abstract": "Pituitary apoplexy (PA) is an acute event related to abrupt degeneration of a pituitary adenoma. Typically the tumor infarcts and undergoes hemorrhage. The authors believe that PA occurs due to venous infarction of an adenoma and as such, there is a variable volume of hemorrhage within the tumor. Patients commonly present with hypopituitarism, sudden symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cranial neuropathy. Cranial nerve palsies vary depending on the degree of mass effect on the cranial nerves traversing the cavernous sinus, suprasellar cistern and the parasellar region. This condition is a medical emergency and correcting pituitary dysfunction is paramount. The most critical consideration to stabilizing patients with apoplexy is related to cardiovascular collapse due to hypocortisolism. Resuscitation with stress dose steroids is essential in the management of these select patients in an emergency department setting. Once these patients have been hemodynamically stabilized, they most often proceed with transsphenoidal surgery, which is meant to rapidly decompress neural structures causing visual disturbance, ophthalmoplegia, or brain compression. Conservative management can be chosen in patients with major comorbidities and/or minimal symptoms related to mass effect.",

METHODS: Following approval by the institutional review board at the Wexner Medical Center at the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, a pilot study with retrospective review of patients with biopsy-proven diagnosis of ONB s and SNUC s was conducted. Staging PET/CT scans were reviewed to document the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). A statistical comparison of SUVmax was performed. RESULTS: We identified 13 patients (7 with ONBs and 6 with SNUCs) with mean age 60.2 years who had undergone staging F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) PET/CT of the primary tumor at the time of their diagnosis. Mean SUVmax was found to be five-fold higher in SNUC patients (35.63, range 10.8-77.9) than in ONB patients (7.24, range 4.6-10.7) (P ≤ 0.00169). CONCLUSION: Maximum standardized uptake value of 18 F-FDG PET/CT can be used to initially discriminate between ONB and SNUC. This finding may prove helpful to guide diagnostic and treatment planning when the histopathologic diagnosis is inconclusive. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4. Laryngoscope, 2016 127:321-324, 2017.",

                  "abstract": "Petroclival meningiomas are challenging lesions to manage independently of the selected surgical approach and are unique tumors in the type of pathological displacement of the surrounding anatomy. They also represent one of the most controversial entities with regard to approach selection, especially when deciding between an open versus endonasal route. When choosing an approach to the intradural portion of the petroclival region, the location of critical neurovascular structures relative to the lesion must be anticipated, including the abducens and trigeminal nerves. The role of the expanded endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) in the management of ventral posterior fossa meningiomas is still restricted due to limited surgical indications in selected cases. It is a safe alternative for the rare cases of meningiomas with most part of its dural base at the midline clival region, and it may be used as solely or combination of other approaches. Thus, appropriate case selection may optimize the advantages of the approach and reduce morbidity of this complex pathology. We discuss in this review article the main advantages and limitations of the EEA for clival and petroclival meningiomas.",

RECENT FINDINGS: New developments in skull base reconstruction continue to arise, mostly as in the form of vascularized pedicled flaps that can be used following endoscopic and open resections of the skull base. SUMMARY: Resection of skull base tumors, often creating large dural defects that couple with extensive intradural dissection, involving multiple cisterns or the third ventricle, may lead to high-flow cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Reconstruction of the skull base is paramount to achieve an uncomplicated postoperative course. Repair of small dural defects can be reliably achieved using a multilayer grafting technique, which yields a high success rate (>90%). Repair of larger defects associated with a high-flow cerebrospinal fluid leak, or defects in previously irradiated fields, often requires a local or regional pedicled vascularized graft as the first reconstructive choice. When these are unavailable, free microvascular tissue transfer remains an option.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the performance of absorbable gelatin sponge (AGS) with polyurethane foam (PUF) as middle ear packing material after mucosal trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a randomized, controlled and blinded study design fifteen guinea pigs underwent middle ear surgery with mucosal trauma performed on both ears. One ear was packed with either PUF or AGS while the contralateral ear remained untreated and used as non-packed paired controls. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured pre-operatively and repeated at 1, 2, and 6weeks postoperatively. Histological analysis of middle ear mucosa was done in each group to evaluate the inflammatory reaction and wound healing. Another eighteen animals underwent middle ear wounding and packing in one ear while the contralateral ear was left undisturbed as control. Twelve guinea pigs were euthanized at 2weeks postoperatively, and six were euthanized at 3days post-operatively. Mucosal samples were collected for analysis of TGF-β1 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: ABR recordings demonstrate that threshold level changes from baseline were minor in PUF packed and control ears. Threshold levels were higher in the AGS packed ears compared with both control and PUF packed ears for low frequency stimuli. Histological analysis showed persistence of packing material at 6weeks postoperatively, inflammation, granulation tissue formation, foreign body reaction and neo-osteogenesis in both AGS and PUF groups. TGF-β1 protein levels did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: PUF and AGS packing cause inflammation and neo-osteogenesis in the middle ear following wounding of the mucosa and packing.",

                  "abstract": "The past two decades have witnessed enormous advances in the field of rhinology and sinonasal diseases. Chronic Sinusitis is one of the most common chronic illnesses. The introduction of functional endoscopic sinus surgery in the late eighties has revolutionized the surgical approach to sinus disease. Since that time, endoscopic sinus surgery has become the surgical procedure of choice and has been adopted for training and teaching. Furthermore, the approach to sinus disease has significantly evolved. We have witnessed the introduction of balloon sinuplasty, image guided surgery, multidisciplinary approach and the promotion of evidence based medicine and guidelines. The essence of any surgical technique or any guideline is based on the wealth of knowledge of anatomy and physiology. This book details the explicit anatomy and pathophysiology of the various sinuses. Special emphasis has been made on pediatric sinus diseases since it is a topic that has not been well covered and mandates further understanding. This unique book can form a roadmap for the otolaryngologist in training, medical students practicing otolaryngologist in private or academic sector and paramedical personnel. The target and scope go beyond otolaryngology to attract the attention of any pediatrician, general practitioner or family medicine specialist. The chapters have been well-written not only to detail the importance of each structure and pathophysiological mechanisms, but also to make it easily understandable for all readers at different levels. The authors have been selected from panels of nationally and intellectually acknowledged experts. The wealth of information in this book has exhausted the efforts of brilliant and well-established, experienced and academically prominent leaders in their fields. All chapters are not only written in easy-to-read detailed paragraphs, but are also illustrated with radiographic and surgical figures adding a live interpretation to the abstractive sentences. It is our hope that this text will serve as a comprehensive contemporary guide and reference to all students and practitioners that aim to widen their horizon of learning, revive their illustrative and descriptive memory of knowledge and improve their expertise.",

They are due to developmental errors in embryogenesis at the level of the anterior neuropore, the central midface or the nasobuccal membrane and are associated with other congenital abnormalities. The differential diagnosis includes epidermoid cysts, hemangiomas, teratomas, neurofibromas, lipomas, lymphangiomas and nasolacrimal duct cysts.

METHODS: The medical records of 14 patients with concomitant pathologies were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Parathyroidectomies (1.3%) and thyroidectomies (3.5%) performed for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma resulted in the diagnosis of concomitant pathologies. Five patients had a primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and nine were operated for thyroidectomy with intraoperative finding of an enlarged parathyroid gland. Patients (64%) were normocalcemic preoperatively. Thirteen had papillary carcinoma. Fifty percent of patients had multiple foci of papillary microcarcinoma. Twenty-nine percent of patients had parathyroid hyperplasia. All patients with preoperative hypercalcemia normalized their serum calcium. During follow-up, thyroglobuline, calcium serum values and cervical ultrasound showed no evidence of recurrence of the diseases. CONCLUSIONS: These observations stress the importance of pre and intraoperative evaluation to detect overt thyroid and parathyroid pathology before performing a parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism or a thyroidectomy for a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma.",

The outcome measure was change in pure-tone thresholds at 500-4000 Hz. Hearing recovery was also recorded as the percentage of subjects with final pure-tone threshold average (PTA) within 50% of the difference between the initial value of the affected ear and the value of the unaffected ear. Comparisons were made between combination (corticosteroids plus LNAC) and single (no LNAC use) therapy groups. RESULTS: At 6 months, the mean PTA improvements were 26.1 dB and 15.1 dB for the combination and single therapy groups, respectively (p = 0.046). Higher gains at 4000 Hz were noted with LNAC use. The percentage of patients with at least 50% recovery was 63% and 35% for the combination and single therapy groups, respectively (p = 0.0319).",

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, and controlled study. SETTING: Tertiary university-based hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three guinea pigs underwent middle ear surgery with mucosal trauma performed on both ears and one ear packed with either EHA or AGS. Contralateral ears were used as nonpacked paired controls. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were measured preoperatively and repeated at 1, 2, and 6 weeks postoperatively. Macroscopic and microscopic analysis measured inflammatory reaction in each group. RESULTS: ABR threshold changes from baseline in the EHA and both control groups were minor. Threshold levels were higher in the AGS group compared with the AGS control group. This trend was seen in each frequency tested at each time interval. Macroscopic analysis showed tympanic membrane perforation was rare, effusions were common in the AGS group, mucosal edema was most frequent in the AGS group, and unabsorbed packing was usually detected in the AGS group with little EHA detectable at 6 weeks. Microscopic analysis showed normal mucosal healing in all groups. Two AGS ears demonstrated excessive middle ear packing with exuberant osteoneogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Middle ear function and mucosal healing after surgery occurred similarly between the EHA control group and the EHA group. In contrast, the AGS group demonstrated worse hearing and a greater level of osteoneogenesis compared with the AGS control group. These results support EHA as an alternative middle ear packing material in otologic surgery.",

MATERIALS: in vivo: A guinea pig model of electrode induced trauma (EIT)-induced hearing loss was used to locally deliver dexamethasone. In vitro: TNF-α-challenged organ of Corti explants treated with DXM or polymer-eluted DXM +/- PI3K/Akt/PkB/NFkB inhibitors were used for hair cells count and gene expression studies. RESULTS: in vivo: local DXM treatment of EIT-animals prevents trauma-induced loss of ABR thresholds that occurs in EIT-animals and EIT-animals treated with the carrier solution (i.e., AP), and prevented loss of auditory hair cells. In vitro: DXM and polymer-eluted DXM were equally effective in protecting hair cells from ototoxic levels of TNF-α Inhibitor treated explants demonstrated that DXM treatment requires both Akt/PKB and NFkB signalling for otoprotection. DXM treatment of explants showed up regulation of anti-apoptosis related genes (i.e., Bcl-2, Bcl-xl) and down regulation of pro-apoptosis related genes (i.e., Bax, TNFR-1). CONCLUSIONS: DXM exert its otoprotective action by activation of cell signal molecules (e.g., NFkB) that alter the expression of anti- and pro-apoptosis genes.",

                  "abstract": "One of the causes of sensorineural hearing loss is the loss of auditory hair cells following exposure to environmental stresses. Auditory hair cell death in response to cochlear trauma occurs via both necrosis and apoptosis. Apoptosis of hair cells involves the caspase and MAPK/JNK pathways which are activated by oxidative stress and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in response to trauma. Identification of the pathways that lead to apoptosis provides therapeutic targets for the conservation of hearing. Antioxidants reduce the level of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species generated by oxidative stress in response to acoustic trauma, aminoglycoside and platinum-based drugs. Caspase inhibitors affect both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways thereby reducing cisplatin, aminoglycoside, hydraulic trauma and ischemia-induced hearing losses. Corticosteroid therapy reduces inflammation and inhibits apoptosis while activating pro-survival pathways in the organ of Corti following exposure to noise, vibration, cisplatin, aminoglycoside, ischemia/reperfusion injury, bacterial meningitis and electrode insertion trauma. Inhibitors of JNK signaling pathway prevent apoptosis of auditory hair cells following electrode insertion trauma, acute labyrinthitis, acoustic trauma and aminoglycoside ototoxicity. This review provides an overview of the different pathways involved in auditory hair cell death following an environmental stress and both traditional and newly developed drugs that are currently being studied or used for the treatment of acute hearing loss. Recent patents related to otoprotective strategies to conserve hearing and auditory hair cells are also discussed in this review.",

Although there is evidence of various molecular pathways that affect these responses, a comprehensive molecular map of these molecular responses to exercise has not been developed. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is a multicenter study designed to isolate the effects of structured exercise training on the molecular mechanisms underlying the health benefits of exercise and physical activity. MoTrPAC contains both a preclinical and human component. The details of the human studies component of MoTrPAC that include the design and methods are presented here. The human studies contain both an adult and pediatric component. In the adult component, sedentary participants are randomized to 12 wk of Control, Endurance Exercise Training, or Resistance Exercise Training with outcomes measures completed before and following the 12 wk. The adult component also includes recruitment of highly active endurance-trained or resistance-trained participants who only complete measures once. A similar design is used for the pediatric component; however, only endurance exercise is examined. Phenotyping measures include weight, body composition, vital signs, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, physical activity and diet, and other questionnaires. Participants also complete an acute rest period (adults only) or exercise session (adults, pediatrics) with collection of biospecimens (blood only for pediatrics) to allow for examination of the molecular responses. The design and methods of MoTrPAC may inform other studies. Moreover, MoTrPAC will provide a repository of data that can be used broadly across the scientific community.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) will be the first large trial to isolate the effects of structured exercise training on the molecular mechanisms underlying the health benefits of exercise and physical activity. By generating a compendium of the molecular responses to exercise, MoTrPAC will lay the foundation for a new era of biomedical research on Precision Exercise Medicine. Presented here is the design, protocols, and procedures for the MoTrPAC human studies.",

Weight gain and hypoglycemia are also important outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes. We compared the effects of the four randomized GRADE medications on a composite outcome incorporating glycemic deterioration, weight gain, and hypoglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The composite outcome was time to first occurrence of any of the following: HbA1c >7.5%, confirmed; ≥5% weight gain; or severe or recurrent nonsevere hypoglycemia. Secondary analyses included examination of individual components of the composite outcome, subgroup effects and potential mediators, and treatment satisfaction. Cumulative incidence was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess pairwise group differences in risk of an outcome. RESULTS: Risk of reaching the composite outcome (events per 100 participants per treatment year [PTYs]) was lowest with liraglutide (19 per 100 PTYs) followed by sitagliptin (26 per 100 PTYs), glargine (29 per 100 PTYs), and glimepiride (40 per 100 PTYs); all pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. The order was the same for risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia, but risk of glycemic deterioration was lowest with glargine, followed by liraglutide, glimepiride, and sitagliptin. No significant heterogeneity in risk of composite outcome was detected across prespecified covariates. Participants who reached the composite outcome had modestly but significantly lower treatment satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants treated with common second-line drug classes for type 2 diabetes, the liraglutide group had the lowest and glimepiride the highest risk of reaching a composite outcome encompassing glycemic deterioration, weight gain, and hypoglycemia. These findings may inform decision-making regarding type 2 diabetes therapy.",

The effects of glucose-lowering medications on cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes and low cardiovascular risk are unclear. We investigated cardiovascular outcomes by treatment group in participants randomly assigned to insulin glargine, glimepiride, liraglutide, or sitagliptin, added to baseline metformin, in GRADE (Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Type 2 Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study). METHODS: A total of 5047 participants with a mean±SD age of 57.2±10.0 years, type 2 diabetes duration of 4.0±2.7 years, and low baseline prevalence of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, 5.1%; cerebrovascular accident, 2.0%) were followed for a median of 5 years. Prespecified outcomes included between-group time-to-first event analyses of MACE-3 (composite of major adverse cardiovascular events: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), MACE-4 (MACE-3+unstable angina requiring hospitalization or revascularization), MACE-5 (MACE-4+coronary revascularization), MACE-6 (MACE-5+hospitalization for heart failure), and the individual components. MACE outcomes and hospitalization for heart failure in the liraglutide-treated group were compared with the other groups combined using Cox proportional hazards models. MACE-6 was also analyzed as recurrent events using a proportional rate model to compare all treatment groups. RESULTS: We observed no statistically significant differences in the cumulative incidence of first MACE-3, MACE-4, MACE-5, or MACE-6, or their individual components, by randomized treatment group. However, when compared with the other treatment groups combined, the liraglutide-treated group had a significantly lower risk of MACE-5 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]; P=0.021), MACE-6 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.55-0.90]; P=0.021), and hospitalization for heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28-0.86]; P=0.022). Compared with the liraglutide group, significantly higher rates of recurrent MACE-6 events occurred in the groups treated with glimepiride (rate ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.13-2.29]) or sitagliptin (rate ratio 1.75; [95% CI, 1.24-2.48]). CONCLUSIONS: This comparative effectiveness study of a contemporary cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes, largely without established cardiovascular disease, suggests that liraglutide treatment may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients at relatively low risk compared with other commonly used glucose-lowering medications.

We sought to examine sex differences in cardiometabolic risk factors and management in the contemporary cohort represented by the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE).<h4>Research design and methods</h4>GRADE enrolled 5047 participants (1837 women, 3210 men) with T2DM on metformin monotherapy at baseline. The current report is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data collected July 2013 to August 2017.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with men, women had a higher mean body mass index (BMI), greater prevalence of severe obesity (BMI≥40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), higher mean LDL cholesterol, greater prevalence of low HDL cholesterol, and were less likely to receive statin treatment and achieve target LDL, with a generally greater prevalence of these risk factors in younger women. Women with hypertension were equally likely to achieve blood pressure targets as men; however, women were less likely to receive ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Women were more likely to be divorced, separated or widowed, and had fewer years of education and lower incomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This contemporary cohort demonstrates that women with T2DM continue to have a greater burden of cardiometabolic and socioeconomic risk factors than men, particularly younger women. Attention to these persisting disparities is needed to reduce the burden of CVD in women.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01794143).",

                  "abstract": "Sinus tachycardia (ST) is ubiquitous, but its presence outside of normal physiological triggers in otherwise healthy individuals remains a commonly encountered phenomenon in medical practice. In many cases, ST can be readily explained by a current medical condition that precipitates an increase in the sinus rate, but ST at rest without physiological triggers may also represent a spectrum of normal. In other cases, ST may not have an easily explainable cause but may represent serious underlying pathology and can be associated with intolerable symptoms. The classification of ST, consideration of possible etiologies, as well as the decisions of when and how to intervene can be difficult. ST can be classified as secondary to a specific, usually treatable, medical condition (eg, pulmonary embolism, anemia, infection, or hyperthyroidism) or be related to several incompletely defined conditions (eg, inappropriate ST, postural tachycardia syndrome, mast cell disorder, or post-COVID syndrome). While cardiologists and cardiac electrophysiologists often evaluate patients with symptoms associated with persistent or paroxysmal ST, an optimal approach remains uncertain. Due to the many possible conditions associated with ST, and an overlap in medical specialists who see these patients, the inclusion of experts in different fields is essential for a more comprehensive understanding.

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cardiovascular risk is associated with paradoxical reductions in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Concentrations of small LDL (LDL-P) and HDL (HDL-P) particles are also reduced with increased inflammation and disease activity in RA patients. Here we sought to identify which measure(s) of inflammation, disease activity and cardiometabolic risk contribute most to the RA-associated lipoprotein profile. METHODS: NMR lipoprotein measurements were obtained for individuals with RA (n = 50) and age-, gender-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls (n = 39). Groups were compared using 39 matched pairs with 11 additional subjects used in RA only analyses. Among RA patients, relationships were determined for lipoprotein parameters with measures of disease activity, disability, pain, inflammation, body composition, insulin sensitivity and exercise. Percentage of time spent in basal activity (<1 metabolic equivalent) and exercise (≥3 metabolic equivalents) were objectively-determined. RESULTS: Subjects with RA had fewer total and small LDL-P as well as larger LDL and HDL size (P < 0.05). Among RA patients, pain and disability were associated with fewer small HDL-P (P < 0.05), while interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, and TNF-α were associated with LDL size (P < 0.05). BMI, waist circumference, abdominal visceral adiposity and insulin resistance were associated with more total and small LDL-P, fewer large HDL-P, and a reduction in HDL size (P < 0.05). Most similar to the RA lipoprotein profile, more basal activity (minimal physical activity) and less exercise time were associated with fewer small LDL-P and total and small HDL-P (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The RA-associated lipoprotein profile is associated with a lack of physical activity. As this was a cross-sectional investigation and not an intervention and was performed from 2008-13, this study was not registered in clinicaltrials.gov.",

Our objective was to explore the relationships of GlycA, a measure of glycosylated acute phase proteins, with inflammation and cardiometabolic risk in RA, and explore whether these relationships were similar to those for persons without RA. METHODS: Plasma GlycA was determined for 50 individuals with mild-moderate RA disease activity and 39 controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). Regression analyses were performed to assess relationships between GlycA and important markers of traditional inflammation and cardio-metabolic health: inflammatory cytokines, disease activity, measures of adiposity and insulin resistance. RESULTS: On average, RA activity was low (DAS-28 = 3.0 ± 1.4). Traditional inflammatory markers, ESR, hsCRP, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-α were greater in RA versus controls (P < 0.05 for all). GlycA concentrations were significantly elevated in RA versus controls (P = 0.036). In RA, greater GlycA associated with disease activity (DAS-28; RDAS-28 = 0.5) and inflammation (RESR = 0.7, RhsCRP = 0.7, RIL-6 = 0.3: P < 0.05 for all); in BMI-matched controls, these inflammatory associations were absent or weaker (hsCRP), but GlycA was related to IL-18 (RhsCRP = 0.3, RIL-18 = 0.4: P < 0.05). In RA, greater GlycA associated with more total abdominal adiposity and less muscle density (Rabdominal-adiposity = 0.3, Rmuscle-density = -0.3, P < 0.05 for both). In BMI-matched controls, GlycA associated with more cardio-metabolic markers: BMI, waist circumference, adiposity measures and insulin resistance (R = 0.3-0.6, P < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: GlycA provides an integrated measure of inflammation with contributions from traditional inflammatory markers and cardio-metabolic sources, dominated by inflammatory markers in persons with RA and cardio-metabolic factors in those without.",

                  "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESES: Obesity is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity (IS) and elevated plasma branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between BCAA metabolism and IS in overweight (OW) individuals during exercise intervention. METHODS: Whole-body leucine turnover, IS by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, and circulating and skeletal muscle amino acids, branched-chain α-keto acids and acylcarnitines were measured in ten healthy controls (Control) and nine OW, untrained, insulin-resistant individuals (OW-Untrained). OW-Untrained then underwent a 6 month aerobic and resistance exercise programme and repeated testing (OW-Trained). RESULTS: IS was higher in Control vs OW-Untrained and increased significantly following exercise. IS was lower in OW-Trained vs Control expressed relative to body mass, but was not different from Control when normalised to fat-free mass (FFM). Plasma BCAAs and leucine turnover (relative to FFM) were higher in OW-Untrained vs Control, but did not change on average with exercise. Despite this, within individuals, the decrease in molar sum of circulating BCAAs was the best metabolic predictor of improvement in IS. Circulating glycine levels were higher in Control and OW-Trained vs OW-Untrained, and urinary metabolic profiling suggests that exercise induces more efficient elimination of excess acyl groups derived from BCAA and aromatic amino acid (AA) metabolism via formation of urinary glycine adducts. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A mechanism involving more efficient elimination of excess acyl groups derived from BCAA and aromatic AA metabolism via glycine conjugation in the liver, rather than increased BCAA disposal through oxidation and turnover, may mediate interactions between exercise, BCAA metabolism and IS.

The present study (Studies Targeting Risk Reduction Interventions through Defined Exercise-Aerobic Training and/or Resistance Training) compared the effects of AT, RT, and the combination (AT/RT) on insulin action at both acute and sustained phases. Subjects (N = 196) were 18-70 yr old (mean age = 50 yr), overweight (mean body mass index = 30 kg/m2), sedentary with moderate dyslipidemia, and were randomized into one of three 8-mo exercise groups: 1) RT: 3 days/wk, 8 exercises, 3 sets/exercise, 8-12 repetitions/set; 2) AT: equivalent to ∼19.2 km/wk (12 miles/wk) at 75% peak O2 consumption; 3) AT/RT: the combination of AT and RT. One hundred forty-four subjects completed the intervention. Eighty-eight subjects completed all pre- and postintervention testing visits. Insulin sensitivity, glucose effectiveness, and disposition index were measured via a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test with subsequent minimal model analyses. AT/RT resulted in greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, β-cell function (disposition index), and glucose effectiveness than either AT or RT alone (all P < 0.05). Approximately 52% of the improvement in insulin sensitivity by AT/RT was retained 14 days after the last exercise training bout. Neither AT or RT led to acute or chronic improvement in sensitivity index. In summary, only AT/RT (which required twice as much time as either alone) led to significant acute and sustained benefits in insulin sensitivity",

                  "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Targeted metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches were used to evaluate the relationship between skeletal muscle metabolite signatures, gene expression profiles and clinical outcomes in response to various exercise training interventions. We hypothesised that changes in mitochondrial metabolic intermediates would predict improvements in clinical risk factors, thereby offering novel insights into potential mechanisms. METHODS: Subjects at risk of metabolic disease were randomised to 6 months of inactivity or one of five aerobic and/or resistance training programmes (n = 112). Pre/post-intervention assessments included cardiorespiratory fitness ([Formula: see text]), serum triacylglycerols (TGs) and insulin sensitivity (SI). In this secondary analysis, muscle biopsy specimens were used for targeted mass spectrometry-based analysis of metabolic intermediates and measurement of mRNA expression of genes involved in metabolism. RESULTS: Exercise regimens with the largest energy expenditure produced robust increases in muscle concentrations of even-chain acylcarnitines (median 37-488%), which correlated positively with increased expression of genes involved in muscle uptake and oxidation of fatty acids. Along with free carnitine, the aforementioned acylcarnitine metabolites were related to improvements in [Formula: see text], TGs and SI (R = 0.20-0.31, p < 0.05). Muscle concentrations of the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates succinate and succinylcarnitine (R = 0.39 and 0.24, p < 0.05) emerged as the strongest correlates of SI. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The metabolic signatures of exercise-trained skeletal muscle reflected reprogramming of mitochondrial function and intermediary metabolism and correlated with changes in cardiometabolic fitness. Succinate metabolism and the succinate dehydrogenase complex emerged as a potential regulatory node that intersects with whole-body insulin sensitivity. This study identifies new avenues for mechanistic research aimed at understanding the health benefits of physical activity.

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In prior reports, individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) exhibited increased insulin resistance. However, those studies were limited by either suboptimal assessment methods for insulin sensitivity or a failure to account for important determinants such as adiposity and lack of physical activity. Our objectives were to carefully assess, compare, and determine predictors of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in RA, accounting for adiposity and physical activity. METHODS: Thirty-nine individuals with established (seropositive or erosions) and treated RA and 39 controls matched for age, sex, race, body mass index, and physical activity underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test to determine insulin sensitivity. Inflammation, body composition, and physical activity were assessed with systemic cytokine measurements, computed tomography scans, and accelerometry, respectively. Exclusions were diabetes, cardiovascular disease, medication changes within 3 months, and prednisone use over 5 mg/day. This investigation was powered to detect a clinically significant, moderate effect size for insulin sensitivity difference. RESULTS: Despite elevated systemic inflammation [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-α; p < 0.05 for all], persons with RA were not less insulin sensitive [SI geometric mean (SD): RA 4.0 (2.4) vs control 4.9 (2.1)*10(-5) min(-1)/(pmol/l); p = 0.39]. Except for visceral adiposity being slightly greater in controls (p = 0.03), there were no differences in body composition or physical activity. Lower insulin sensitivity was independently associated with increased abdominal and thigh adiposity, but not with cytokines, disease activity, duration, disability, or disease-modifying medication use. CONCLUSION: In established and treated RA, traditional risk factors, specifically excess adiposity, play more of a role in predicting skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity than do systemic inflammation or other disease-related factors.",

                  "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic that greatly increases mortality due to cardiovascular disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an important mechanism of cardiac injury in CKD. High serum levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 in patients with CKD may contribute mechanistically to the pathogenesis of LVH by activating FGF receptor (FGFR) 4 signaling in cardiac myocytes. Mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac metabolic remodeling are early features of cardiac injury that predate development of hypertrophy, but these mechanisms have been insufficiently studied in models of CKD. We found in wild-type mice with CKD induced by adenine diet, that morphological changes occurred in mitochondrial structure and cardiac mitochondrial and that metabolic dysfunction preceded the development of LVH. In bioengineered cardio-bundles and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes grown in vitro, FGF23-mediated activation of FGFR4 caused mitochondrial pathology, characterized by increased bioenergetic stress and increased glycolysis that preceded the development of cellular hypertrophy. The cardiac metabolic changes and associated mitochondrial alterations in mice with CKD were prevented by global and cardiac-specific deletion of FGFR4. Our findings indicate that metabolic remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction are early cardiac complications of CKD that precede structural remodeling of the heart. Mechanistically, FGF23-mediated activation of FGFR4 causes mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that early pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR4 might serve as novel therapeutic intervention to prevent development of LVH and heart failure in patients with CKD.",

                  "abstract": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) caused by chronic pressure overload with subsequent pathological remodeling is a major cardiovascular risk factor for heart failure and mortality. The role of deubiquitinases in LVH has not been well characterized. To define whether the deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 20 (USP20) regulates LVH, we subjected USP20 knockout (KO) and cognate wild-type (WT) mice to chronic pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and measured changes in cardiac function by serial echocardiography followed by histological and biochemical evaluations. USP20-KO mice showed severe deterioration of systolic function within 4 wk of TAC compared with WT cohorts. Both USP20-KO TAC and WT-TAC cohorts presented cardiac hypertrophy following pressure overload. However, USP20-KO-TAC mice showed an increase in cardiomyocyte length and developed maladaptive eccentric hypertrophy, a phenotype generally observed with volume overload states and decompensated heart failure. In contrast, WT-TAC mice displayed an increase in cardiomyocyte width, producing concentric remodeling that is characteristic of pressure overload. In addition, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis, and mouse mortality were augmented in USP20-KO-TAC compared with WT-TAC mice. Quantitative mass spectrometry of LV tissue revealed that the expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7), a fetal gene normally upregulated during cardiac remodeling, was significantly reduced in USP20-KO after TAC. Mechanistically, we identified increased degradative lysine-48 polyubiquitination of MYH7 in USP20-KO hearts, indicating that USP20-mediated deubiquitination likely prevents protein degradation of MYH7 during pressure overload. Our findings suggest that USP20-dependent signaling pathways regulate the layering pattern of sarcomeres to suppress maladaptive remodeling during chronic pressure overload and prevent cardiac failure.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We identify ubiquitin-specific peptidase 20 (USP20) as an important enzyme that is required for cardiac homeostasis and function, particularly during myocardial pressure overload. USP20 regulates protein stability of cardiac MYH7, an essential molecular motor protein expressed in sarcomeres; loss-of-function mutations of MYH7 are associated with human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, and sudden death. Enhancing USP20 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach to prevent the development of maladaptive state of eccentric hypertrophy and heart failure.",

To model this risk, healthy male c57BL/6 mice aged six months (corresponding to an astronaut of 34 years) were exposed to simplified galactic cosmic ray (GCR5-ion; 5-ion sim) irradiation at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratories (BNL). Multi-modal cardiovascular functional assessments performed longitudinally and terminally revealed significant impairment in cardiac function in mice exposed to GCR5-ion compared to unirradiated controls, gamma irradiation, or single mono-energetic ions (56Fe or 16O). GCR5-ion-treated mice exhibited increased arterial elastance likely mediated by disruption of elastin fibers.

Specific echocardiographic markers are not typically used to trigger alarm before acute HFpEF decompensation. The goal of this study was to retrospectively track changes in echocardiographic markers leading to the time of incident HFpEF hospitalization. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a single-center, retrospective analysis, patients with HFpEF admitted between 2007 and 2014 were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision with search refined using the European Society of Cardiology HFpEF guidelines. Using linear mixed effects models, changes in echocardiographic markers preceding acute HF decompensation owing to incident HFpEF were analyzed. We report on an incident HFpEF cohort of 242 patients, extending 18 years retrospectively, and including 675 echocardiograms analyzed from the overall sample at 14 distinct time intervals before acute decompensation. The regression models demonstrated 3 echocardiographic markers with statistically significant increases across multiple time intervals including, arterial elastance (P = .006), right atrial pressure estimate (P < .001), and right ventricular systolic pressure (P = .006). Other echocardiographic markers had individual time intervals with significant increases before acute decompensation, including (a) left atrial diameter, 8 to 10 years before HFpEF diagnosis, (b) left ventricular filling pressure 2 to 6 years before HFpEF diagnosis, (c) ventricular elastance 3 to 6 months before HFpEF diagnosis, and (d) ventricular elastance/arterial elastance as early as 10 to 20 years and as late as 3 to 6 months before HFpEF diagnosis. Furthermore, African Americans presented with incident HFpEF at an average younger age than White patients (65.6 ± 15.2 years vs. 76.7 years ± 11.7, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive echocardiographic markers associated with incident HFpEF diagnosis showed long, mid, and acute range, significant changes as far back as 10 to 20 years and as close as 3 to 6 months before acute HFpEF decompensation. Including a diverse study cohort is critical to understanding the phenotypic differences of HFpEF.

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Late cardiac toxicity is a major side effect of radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer. We developed and characterized a mouse model of radiation-induced heart disease that mimics the dose, fractionation, and beam arrangement of left breast and chest wall RT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Female wild-type (C57BL6/J) and atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice (on a C57BL/6J background) on regular chow were treated with 2 Gy × 25 fractions of partial-heart irradiation via opposed tangential beams to the left chest wall. The changes in myocardial perfusion and cardiac function of C57BL/6J mice were examined by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and echocardiography, respectively. In addition to SPECT and echocardiography, the formation of calcified plaques and changes in cardiac function of ApoE-/- mice were examined by dual-energy microCT (DE-CT) and pressure-volume (PV) loop analysis, respectively. The development of myocardial fibrosis was examined by histopathology. RESULTS: Compared to unirradiated controls, irradiated C57BL/6J mice showed no significant changes by SPECT or echocardiography up to 18 months after 2 Gy × 25 partial-heart irradiation even though irradiated mice exhibited a modest increase in myocardial fibrosis. For ApoE-/- mice, 2 Gy × 25 partial-heart irradiation did not cause significant changes by SPECT, DE-CT, or echocardiography. However, PV loop analysis revealed a significant decrease in load-dependent systolic and diastolic function measures including cardiac output, dV/dtmax and dV/dt min 12 months after RT. CONCLUSIONS: Following clinically relevant doses of partial-heart irradiation in C57BL/6J and ApoE-/- mice, assessment with noninvasive imaging modalities such as echocardiography, SPECT, and DE-CT yielded no evidence of decreased myocardial perfusion and cardiac dysfunction related to RT. However, invasive hemodynamic assessment with PV loop analysis indicated subtle, but significant, changes in cardiac function of irradiated ApoE-/- mice. PV loop analysis may be useful for future preclinical studies of radiation-induced heart disease, especially if subtle changes in cardiac function are expected.",

RA's distinct impact on cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue is suggested by studies showing that new RA pharmacologic agents strongly improve joint inflammation, but have little impact on RA-associated mortality, cardiovascular disease, and sarcopenia. Thus, the objective is to understand the distinct effects of RA on cardiac and skeletal muscle, and to therapeutically target these tissues through endurance-based exercise as a way to improve RA mortality and morbidity. We utilize the well-characterized RA mouse model, the K/BxN mouse, to investigate cardiac and skeletal muscle pathologies, including the use of wheel-running exercise to mitigate these pathologies. Strikingly, we found that K/BxN mice, like patients with RA, also exhibit both cardiac and skeletal muscle myopathies that were correlated with circulating IL-6 levels. Three months of wheel-running exercise significantly improved K/BxN joint swelling and reduced systemic IL-6 concentrations. Importantly, there were morphological, gene expression, and functional improvements in both the skeletal muscle and cardiac myopathies with exercise. The K/BxN mouse model of RA recapitulated important RA clinical comorbidities, including altered joint, cardiac and skeletal muscle function. These morphological, molecular, and functional alterations were mitigated with regular exercise, thus suggesting exercise as a potential therapeutic intervention to lessen disease activity in the joint and the peripheral tissues, including the heart and skeletal muscle.NEW & NOTEWORTHY RA, even when controlled, is associated with skeletal muscle weakness and greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Using exercise as a therapeutic against, the progression of RA is often avoided due to fear of worsening RA pathology. We introduce the K/BxN mouse as an RA model to study both myocardial and skeletal muscle dysfunction. We show that endurance exercise can improve joint, cardiac, and skeletal muscle function in K/BxN mice, suggesting exercise may be beneficial for patients with RA.",

                  "abstract": "Activation of AT1 (type 1 Ang) receptors stimulates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. Accordingly, it has been suggested that regression of cardiac hypertrophy associated with renin-Ang system blockade is due to inhibition of cellular actions of Ang II in the heart, above and beyond their effects to reduce pressure overload. We generated 2 distinct mouse lines with cell-specific deletion of AT1A receptors, from cardiomyocytes. In the first line (C-SMKO), elimination of AT1A receptors was achieved using a heterologous Cre recombinase transgene under control of the Sm22 promoter, which expresses in cells of smooth muscle lineage including cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells of conduit but not resistance vessels. The second line (R-SMKO) utilized a Cre transgene knocked-in to the Sm22 locus, which drives expression in cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in both conduit and resistance arteries. Thus, although both groups lack AT1 receptors in the cardiomyocytes, they are distinguished by presence (C-SMKO) or absence (R-SMKO) of peripheral vascular responses to Ang II. Similar to wild-types, chronic Ang II infusion caused hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy in C-SMKO mice, whereas both hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy were reduced in R-SMKOs. Thus, despite the absence of AT1A receptors in cardiomyocytes, C-SMKOs develop robust cardiac hypertrophy. By contrast, R-SMKOs developed identical levels of hypertrophy in response to pressure overload-induced by transverse aortic banding. Our findings suggest that direct activation of AT1 receptors in cardiac myocytes has minimal influence on cardiac hypertrophy induced by renin-Ang system activation or pressure overload.",

                  "abstract": "RATIONALE: Circumstantial evidence links the development of heart failure to posttranslational modifications of mitochondrial proteins, including lysine acetylation (Kac). Nonetheless, direct evidence that Kac compromises mitochondrial performance remains sparse. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore the premise that mitochondrial Kac contributes to heart failure by disrupting oxidative metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: A DKO (dual knockout) mouse line with deficiencies in CrAT (carnitine acetyltransferase) and Sirt3 (sirtuin 3)-enzymes that oppose Kac by buffering the acetyl group pool and catalyzing lysine deacetylation, respectively-was developed to model extreme mitochondrial Kac in cardiac muscle, as confirmed by quantitative acetyl-proteomics. The resulting impact on mitochondrial bioenergetics was evaluated using a respiratory diagnostics platform that permits comprehensive assessment of mitochondrial function and energy transduction. Susceptibility of DKO mice to heart failure was investigated using transaortic constriction as a model of cardiac pressure overload. The mitochondrial acetyl-lysine landscape of DKO hearts was elevated well beyond that observed in response to pressure overload or Sirt3 deficiency alone. Relative changes in the abundance of specific acetylated lysine peptides measured in DKO versus Sirt3 KO hearts were strongly correlated. A proteomics comparison across multiple settings of hyperacetylation revealed ≈86% overlap between the populations of Kac peptides affected by the DKO manipulation as compared with experimental heart failure. Despite the severity of cardiac Kac in DKO mice relative to other conditions, deep phenotyping of mitochondrial function revealed a surprisingly normal bioenergetics profile. Thus, of the >120 mitochondrial energy fluxes evaluated, including substrate-specific dehydrogenase activities, respiratory responses, redox charge, mitochondrial membrane potential, and electron leak, we found minimal evidence of oxidative insufficiencies. Similarly, DKO hearts were not more vulnerable to dysfunction caused by transaortic constriction-induced pressure overload. CONCLUSIONS: The findings challenge the premise that hyperacetylation per se threatens metabolic resilience in the myocardium by causing broad-ranging disruption to mitochondrial oxidative machinery.",

Clinical development of NTSR1 agonists has, however, been precluded by their severe side effects. NTSR1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), signals through the canonical activation of G proteins and engages β-arrestins to mediate distinct cellular signaling events. Here, we characterize the allosteric NTSR1 modulator SBI-553. This small molecule not only acts as a β-arrestin-biased agonist but also extends profound β-arrestin bias to the endogenous ligand by selectively antagonizing G protein signaling. SBI-553 shows efficacy in animal models of psychostimulant abuse, including cocaine self-administration, without the side effects characteristic of balanced NTSR1 agonism. These findings indicate that NTSR1 G protein and β-arrestin activation produce discrete and separable physiological effects, thus providing a strategy to develop safer GPCR-targeting therapeutics with more directed pharmacological action.",

This study sought to estimate the prevalence and consequences of PH subtypes in the setting of CKD. STUDY DESIGN: Observational retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We examined 12,618 patients with a right heart catheterization in the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014. EXPOSURES: Baseline kidney function stratified by CKD glomerular filtration rate category and PH subtype. OUTCOMES: All-cause mortality. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: In this cohort, 73.4% of patients with CKD had PH, compared with 56.9% of patients without CKD. Isolated postcapillary PH (39.0%) and combined pre- and postcapillary PH (38.3%) were the most common PH subtypes in CKD. Conversely, precapillary PH was the most common subtype in the non-CKD cohort (35.9%). The relationships between mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and right atrial pressure with mortality were similar in both the CKD and non-CKD cohorts. Compared with those without PH, precapillary PH conferred the highest mortality risk among patients without CKD (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 2.00-2.57). By contrast, in those with CKD, combined pre- and postcapillary PH was associated with the highest risk for mortality in CKD in adjusted analyses (compared with no PH, HRs of 1.89 [95% CI, 1.57-2.28], 1.87 [95% CI, 1.52-2.31], 2.13 [95% CI, 1.52-2.97], and 1.63 [95% CI, 1.12-2.36] for glomerular filtration rate categories G3a, G3b, G4, and G5/G5D). LIMITATIONS: The cohort referred for right heart catheterization may not be generalizable to the general population. Serum creatinine data in the 6 months preceding catheterization may not reflect true baseline CKD. Observational design precludes assumptions of causality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CKD referred for right heart catheterization, PH is common and associated with poor survival. Combined pre- and postcapillary PH was common and portended the worst survival for patients with CKD.",

Specific targeting of fibroblasts may thus enable new therapeutic strategies to delay or reverse the progression of heart failure and cardiac fibrosis. However, it remains unknown if all CFs are equally responsive to specific pathological insults and if there exist sub-populations of resident fibroblasts in the heart that have distinctive pathogenic phenotypes. Here, we show that in response to transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced heart failure, previously uncharacterized Thy1neg (Thy1-/MEFSK4+/CD45-/CD31-) fraction of mouse ventricular fibroblasts became more abundant and attained a more activated, pro-fibrotic myofibroblast phenotype compared to Thy1Pos fraction. In a tissue-engineered 3D co-culture model of healthy cardiomyocytes and freshly isolated CFs, Thy1neg CFs from TAC hearts significantly decreased cardiomyocyte contractile function and calcium transient amplitude, and increased extracellular collagen deposition yielding a profibrotic heart tissue phenotype. In vivo, mice with global knockout of Thy1 developed more severe cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis in response to TAC-induced heart failure than wild-type mice. Taken together, our studies identify cardiac myofibroblasts lacking Thy1 as a pathogenic CF fraction in cardiac fibrosis and suggest important roles of Thy1 in pathophysiology of heart failure.",

Here, we investigate the role of TASK-1 and TASK-3 in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction using both human tissue and mouse models of genetic TASK channel loss of function. Compared with normal human cardiac tissue, TASK-1 gene expression is reduced in association with either cardiac hypertrophy alone or combined cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. In a pressure overload cardiomyopathy model, TASK-1 global knockout (TASK-1 KO) mice have both reduced cardiac hypertrophy and preserved cardiac function compared with wild-type mice. In contrast to the TASK-1 KO mouse pressure overload response, TASK-3 global knockout (TASK-3 KO) mice develop cardiac hypertrophy and a delayed onset of cardiac dysfunction compared with wild-type mice. The cardioprotective effects observed in TASK-1 KO mice are associated with pressure overload-induced augmentation of AKT phosphorylation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) expression, with consequent augmentation of cardiac energetics and fatty acid oxidation.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human (rh) GAA has limitations, including inefficient uptake of rhGAA in skeletal muscle linked to low cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) expression. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that antihypertensive agents causing muscle hypertrophy by increasing insulin-like growth factor 1 expression can increase CI-MPR-mediated uptake of recombinant enzyme with therapeutic effects in skeletal muscle. METHODS: Three such agents were evaluated in mice with Pompe disease (carvedilol, losartan, and propranolol), either with or without concurrent ERT. RESULTS: Carvedilol, a selective β-blocker, increased muscle strength but reduced biochemical correction from ERT. Administration of drugs alone had minimal effect, with the exception of losartan that increased glycogen storage and mortality either by itself or in combination with ERT. CONCLUSION: The β-blocker carvedilol had beneficial effects during ERT in mice with Pompe disease, in comparison with propranolol or losartan.

We report that ubiquitin-specific protease 20 (USP20) deubiquitinates and attenuates lysosomal trafficking of the β1AR. β1AR-induced phosphorylation of USP20 Ser-333 by protein kinase A-α (PKAα) was required for optimal USP20-mediated regulation of β1AR lysosomal trafficking. Both phosphomimetic (S333D) and phosphorylation-impaired (S333A) USP20 possess intrinsic deubiquitinase activity equivalent to WT activity. However, unlike USP20 WT and S333D, the S333A mutant associated poorly with the β1AR and failed to deubiquitinate the β1AR. USP20-KO mice showed normal baseline systolic function but impaired β1AR-induced contractility and relaxation. Dobutamine stimulation did not increase cAMP in USP20-KO left ventricles (LVs), whereas NKH477-induced adenylyl cyclase activity was equivalent to WT. The USP20 homolog USP33, which shares redundant roles with USP20, had no effect on β1AR ubiquitination, but USP33 was up-regulated in USP20-KO hearts suggesting compensatory regulation. Myocardial β1AR expression in USP20-KO was drastically reduced, whereas β2AR expression was maintained as determined by radioligand binding in LV sarcolemmal membranes. Phospho-USP20 was significantly increased in LVs of wildtype (WT) mice after a 1-week catecholamine infusion and a 2-week chronic pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Phospho-USP20 was undetectable in β1AR KO mice subjected to TAC, suggesting a role for USP20 phosphorylation in cardiac response to pressure overload. We conclude that USP20 regulates β1AR signaling in vitro and in vivo Additionally, β1AR-induced USP20 phosphorylation may serve as a feed-forward mechanism to stabilize β1AR expression and signaling during pathological insults to the myocardium.",

A number of recent studies point to SIRT5 desuccinylase activity being important in maintaining cardiac function and metabolism under stress. Previously, we described a phenotype of increased mortality in whole-body SIRT5KO mice exposed to chronic pressure overload compared with their littermate WT controls. To determine whether the survival phenotype we reported was due to a cardiac-intrinsic or cardiac-extrinsic effect of SIRT5, we developed a tamoxifen-inducible, heart-specific SIRT5 knockout (SIRT5KO) mouse model. Using our new animal model, we discovered that postnatal cardiac ablation of Sirt5 resulted in persistent accumulation of protein succinylation up to 30 weeks after SIRT5 depletion. Succinyl proteomics revealed that succinylation increased on proteins of oxidative metabolism between 15 and 31 weeks after ablation. Heart-specific SIRT5KO mice were exposed to chronic pressure overload to induce cardiac hypertrophy. We found that, in contrast to whole-body SIRT5KO mice, there was no difference in survival between heart-specific SIRT5KO mice and their littermate controls.

                  "abstract": "The \"brain-gut\" peptide ghrelin, which mediates food-seeking behaviors, is recognized as a very strong endogenous modulator of dopamine (DA) signaling. Ghrelin binds the G protein-coupled receptor GHSR1a, and administration of ghrelin increases the rewarding properties of psychostimulants while ghrelin receptor antagonists decrease them. In addition, the GHSR1a signals through βarrestin-2 to regulate actin/stress fiber rearrangement, suggesting βarrestin-2 participation in the regulation of actin-mediated synaptic plasticity for addictive substances like cocaine. The effects of ghrelin receptor ligands on reward strongly suggest that modulation of ghrelin signaling could provide an effective strategy to ameliorate undesirable behaviors arising from addiction. To investigate this possibility, we tested the effects of ghrelin receptor antagonism in a cocaine behavioral sensitization paradigm using DA neuron-specific βarrestin-2 KO mice. Our results show that these mice sensitize to cocaine as well as wild-type littermates. The βarrestin-2 KO mice, however, no longer respond to the locomotor attenuating effects of the GHSR1a antagonist YIL781. The data presented here suggest that the separate stages of addictive behavior differ in their requirements for βarrestin-2 and show that pharmacological inhibition of βarrestin-2 function through GHSR1a antagonism is not equivalent to the loss of βarrestin-2 function achieved by genetic ablation. These data support targeting GHSR1a signaling in addiction therapy but indicate that using signaling biased compounds that modulate βarrestin-2 activity differentially from G protein activity may be required.",

Although a wide range of SIRT5 targets have been identified, the overall function of SIRT5 in organismal metabolic homeostasis remains unclear. Given that SIRT5 expression is highest in the heart and that sirtuins are commonly stress-response proteins, we used an established model of pressure overload-induced heart muscle hypertrophy caused by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to determine SIRT5's role in cardiac stress responses. Remarkably, SIRT5KO mice had reduced survival upon TAC compared with wild-type mice but exhibited no mortality when undergoing a sham control operation. The increased mortality with TAC was associated with increased pathological hypertrophy and with key abnormalities in both cardiac performance and ventricular compliance. By combining high-resolution MS-based metabolomic and proteomic analyses of cardiac tissues from wild-type and SIRT5KO mice, we found several biochemical abnormalities exacerbated in the SIRT5KO mice, including apparent decreases in fatty acid oxidation and glucose oxidation as well as an overall decrease in mitochondrial NAD+/NADH. Together, these abnormalities suggest that SIRT5 deacylates protein substrates involved in cellular oxidative metabolism to maintain mitochondrial energy production. Overall, the functional and metabolic results presented here suggest an accelerated development of cardiac dysfunction in SIRT5KO mice in response to TAC, explaining increased mortality upon cardiac stress. Our findings reveal a key role for SIRT5 in maintaining cardiac oxidative metabolism under pressure overload to ensure survival.",

Previous studies showed that cardiac Mdm2 expression is critical for controlling p53-dependent apoptosis during early embryonic development, but the role of Mdm2 in the developed adult heart is unknown. We aimed to identify if Mdm2 affects βAR signaling and cardiac function in adult mice. Using Mdm2/p53-KO mice, which survive for 9-12 months, we identified a critical and potentially novel role for Mdm2 in the adult mouse heart through its regulation of cardiac β1AR signaling. While baseline cardiac function was mostly similar in both Mdm2/p53-KO and wild-type (WT) mice, isoproterenol-induced cardiac contractility in Mdm2/p53-KO was significantly blunted compared with WT mice. Isoproterenol increased cAMP in left ventricles of WT but not of Mdm2/p53-KO mice. Additionally, while basal and forskolin-induced calcium handling in isolated Mdm2/p53-KO and WT cardiomyocytes were equivalent, isoproterenol-induced calcium handling in Mdm2/p53-KO was impaired. Mdm2/p53-KO hearts expressed 2-fold more GRK2 than WT. GRK2 polyubiquitination via lysine-48 linkages was significantly reduced in Mdm2/p53-KO hearts. Tamoxifen-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Mdm2 in adult mice also led to a significant increase in GRK2, and resulted in severely impaired cardiac function, high mortality, and no detectable βAR responsiveness. Gene delivery of either Mdm2 or GRK2-CT in vivo using adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) effectively rescued β1AR-induced cardiac contractility in Mdm2/p53-KO. These findings reveal a critical p53-independent physiological role of Mdm2 in adult hearts, namely, regulation of GRK2-mediated desensitization of βAR signaling.",

While NMN influences several aspects of mitochondrial metabolism, the molecular mechanisms by which increased NAD+ enhances cardiac function are poorly understood. A putative mechanism of NAD+ therapeutic action exists via activation of the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). We assessed the therapeutic efficacy of NMN and the role of SIRT3 in the Friedreich's ataxia cardiomyopathy mouse model (FXN-KO). At baseline, the FXN-KO heart has mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation, reduced Sirt3 mRNA expression, and evidence of increased NAD+ salvage. Remarkably, NMN administered to FXN-KO mice restores cardiac function to near-normal levels. To determine whether SIRT3 is required for NMN therapeutic efficacy, we generated SIRT3-KO and SIRT3-KO/FXN-KO (double KO [dKO]) models. The improvement in cardiac function upon NMN treatment in the FXN-KO is lost in the dKO model, demonstrating that the effects of NMN are dependent upon cardiac SIRT3. Coupled with cardio-protection, SIRT3 mediates NMN-induced improvements in both cardiac and extracardiac metabolic function and energy metabolism. Taken together, these results serve as important preclinical data for NMN supplementation or SIRT3 activator therapy in Friedreich's ataxia patients.",

Identified more than a century ago, the Frank-Starling relationship is currently known to involve length-dependent enhancement of cardiac myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. However, the upstream molecular events that link cellular stretch to the length-dependent myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity are poorly understood. Because the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the multifunctional transducer protein β-arrestin have been shown to mediate mechanosensitive cellular signaling, we tested the hypothesis that these two proteins are involved in the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart. Using invasive hemodynamics, we found that mice lacking β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, or AT1R were unable to generate a Frank-Starling force in response to changes in cardiac volume. Although wild-type mice pretreated with the conventional AT1R blocker losartan were unable to enhance cardiac contractility with volume loading, treatment with a β-arrestin-biased AT1R ligand to selectively activate β-arrestin signaling preserved the Frank-Starling relationship. Importantly, in skinned muscle fiber preparations, we found markedly impaired length-dependent myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity in β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and AT1R knockout mice. Our data reveal β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and AT1R as key regulatory molecules in the Frank-Starling mechanism, which potentially can be targeted therapeutically with β-arrestin-biased AT1R ligands.",

These techniques were originally developed nearly three decades ago to measure cardiac function in large mammals and humans. The application of these analyses to small mammals, such as mice, has been accomplished through the optimization of microsurgical techniques and creation of conductance catheters. Conductance catheters allow for estimation of the blood pool by exploiting the relationship between electrical conductance and volume. When properly performed, these techniques allow for testing of cardiac function in genetic mutant mouse models or in drug treatment studies. The accuracy and precision of these studies are dependent on careful attention to the calibration of instruments, systematic conduct of hemodynamic measurements and data analyses.

We investigated the secretion and activity of exosomes containing a key receptor in cardiovascular function, the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R). METHODS AND RESULTS: Exosomes containing AT1Rs were isolated from the media overlying AT1R-overexpressing cells exposed to osmotic stretch and from sera of mice undergoing cardiac pressure overload. The presence of AT1Rs in exosomes was confirmed by both electron microscopy and radioligand receptor binding assays and shown to require β-arrestin2, a multifunctional adaptor protein essential for receptor trafficking. We show that functional AT1Rs are transferred via exosomes in an in vitro model of cellular stretch. Using mice with global and cardiomyocyte conditional deletion of β-arrestin2, we show that under conditions of in vivo pressure overload the cellular source of the exocytosis of exosomes containing AT1R is the cardiomyocyte. Exogenously administered AT1R-enriched exosomes target cardiomyocytes, skeletal myocytes, and mesenteric resistance vessels and are sufficient to confer blood pressure responsiveness to angiotensin II infusion in AT1R knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: AT1R-enriched exosomes are released from the heart under conditions of in vivo cellular stress to likely modulate vascular responses to neurohormonal stimulation. In the context of the whole organism, the concept of G protein-coupled receptor trafficking should consider circulating exosomes as part of the reservoir of functional AT1Rs.",

While modifiers of SERCA function have been identified and studied using animal models, further investigation has been limited by the absence of a model system that is amenable to large-scale genetic screens. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model system for the investigation of SERCA function due to the significant homology to human SERCA and the availability of versatile genetic screening tools. To further the use of Drosophila as a model for examining the role of SERCA in cardiac function, we examined cardiac function in adult flies. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging in awake, adult Drosophila, we have been able to characterize cardiac chamber dimensions in flies with disrupted in Drosophila SERCA (CaP60A). We found that the best studied CaP60A mutant, the conditional paralytic mutant CaP60A(kum170), develops marked bradycardia and chamber enlargement that is closely linked to the onset of paralysis and dependent on extra cardiac CaP60A. In contrast to prior work, we show that disruption of CaP60A in a cardiac specific manner results in cardiac dilation and dysfunction rather than alteration in heart rate. In addition, the co-expression of a calcium release channel mutation with CaP60A (kum170) is sufficient to rescue the cardiac phenotype but not paralysis. Finally, we show that CaP60A overexpression is able to rescue cardiac function in a model of Drosophila cardiac dysfunction similar to what is observed in mammals. Thus, we present a cardiac phenotype associated with Drosophila SERCA dysfunction that would serve as additional phenotyping for further large-scale genetic screens for novel modifiers of SERCA function.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that a β-arrestin-biased AT1R ligand TRV120023 would confer cardioprotection in response to acute cardiac injury compared with the traditional AT1R blocker (ARB), losartan. TRV120023 promotes cardiac contractility, assessed by pressure-volume loop analyses, while blocking the effects of endogenous ANG II. Compared with losartan, TRV120023 significantly activates MAPK and Akt signaling pathways. These hemodynamic and biochemical effects were lost in β-arrestin-2 knockout (KO) mice. In response to cardiac injury induced by ischemia reperfusion injury or mechanical stretch, pretreatment with TRV120023 significantly diminishes cell death compared with losartan, which did not appear to be cardioprotective. This cytoprotective effect was lost in β-arrestin-2 KO mice. The β-arrestin-biased AT1R ligand, TRV120023, has cardioprotective and functional properties in vivo, which are distinct from losartan.

Many Minute loci correspond to disruptions of genes for cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, and therefore the phenotype has been attributed to alterations in translational processes. Although protein translation is crucial for all cells in an organism, it is unclear why Minute mutations cause effects in specific tissues. To determine whether the heart is sensitive to haplo-insufficiency of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, we measured heart function of Minute mutants using optical coherence tomography. We found that cardiomyopathy is associated with the Minute syndrome caused by haplo-insufficiency of genes encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. While mutations of genes encoding non-Minute cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins are homozygous lethal, heterozygous deficiencies spanning these non-Minute genes did not cause a change in cardiac function. Deficiencies of genes for non-Minute mitochondrial ribosomal proteins also did not show abnormal cardiac function, with the exception of a heterozygous disruption of mRpS33. We demonstrate that cardiomyopathy is a common trait of the Minute syndrome caused by haplo-insufficiency of genes encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins.

                  "abstract": "RATIONALE: Normal cardiac physiology requires highly regulated cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and abnormalities in Ca(2+) handling are associated with heart failure. The majority of approaches to identifying the components that regulate intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics rely on cells in culture, mouse models, and human samples. However, a genetically robust system for unbiased screens of mutations that affect Ca(2+) handling remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a new method to measure myocardial Ca(2+) cycling in adult Drosophila and determine whether cardiomyopathic fly hearts recapitulate aspects of diseased mammalian myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using engineered transgenic Drosophila that have cardiac-specific expression of Ca(2+)-sensing fluorescent protein, GCaMP2, we developed methods to measure parameters associated with myocardial Ca(2+) handling. The following key observations were identified: (1) Control w(1118) Drosophila hearts have readily measureable Ca(2+)-dependent fluorescent signals that are dependent on L-type Ca(2+) channels and SR Ca(2+) stores and originate from rostral and caudal pacemakers. (2) A fly mutant, held-up(2) (hdp(2)), that has a point mutation in troponin I and has a dilated cardiomyopathic phenotype demonstrates abnormalities in myocardial Ca(2+) handling that include increases in the duration of the 50% rise in intensity to peak intensity, the half-time of fluorescence decline from peak, the full duration at half-maximal intensity, and decreases in the linear slope of decay from 80% to 20% intensity decay. (3) Hearts from hdp(2) mutants had reductions in caffeine-induced Ca(2+) increases and reductions in ryanodine receptor (RyR) without changes in L-type Ca(2+) channel transcripts in comparison with w(1118). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the cardiac-specific expression of GCaMP2 provides a means of characterizing propagating Ca(2+) transients in adult fly hearts. Moreover, the adult fruit fly heart recapitulates several aspects of Ca(2+) regulation observed in mammalian myocardium. A mutation in Drosophila that causes an enlarged cardiac chamber and impaired contractile function is associated with abnormalities in the cytosolic Ca(2+) transient as well as changes in transcript levels of proteins associated with Ca(2+) handling. This new methodology has the potential to permit an examination of evolutionarily conserved myocardial Ca(2+)-handing mechanisms by applying the vast resources available in the fly genomics community to conduct genetic screens to identify new genes involved in generated Ca(2+) transients and arrhythmias.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between hostility and platelet reactivity in individuals without a prior history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Hostility is associated with incident CVD events, independent of traditional risk factors. Increased platelet reactivity and thrombus formation over a disrupted coronary plaque are fundamental for CVD event onset. METHODS: Hypertensive patients (n = 42) without concomitant CVD event history completed the 50-item Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, and a subset score of 27 items (Barefoot Ho) was derived. We examined the relationship between Barefoot Ho scores and platelet aggregation. We also examined individual components of Barefoot Ho (aggressive responding, cynicism, and hostile affect) and their associations with platelet aggregation. Platelet reactivity, induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), was assessed by standard light transmission aggregometry, the current gold standard method of platelet aggregation assessment. RESULTS: Barefoot Ho scores were related significantly to increased rate of platelet aggregation in response to ADP. Of the three Barefoot Ho components, only aggressive responding was associated independently with increased platelet aggregation rate. The strength of these relationships did not diminish after adjusting for several standard CVD risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that hostility, particularly the aggressive responding subtype, is associated with platelet reactivity-a key pathophysiological pathway in the onset of CVD events.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Home blood pressure (HBP) monitoring plays an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. We evaluated the independent value of HBP compared with ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and office blood pressure (OBP) in the prediction of cardiovascular end-organ damage in normotensive subjects and untreated patients with mild hypertension. METHODS: One hundred sixty-three subjects underwent measurements of OBP, HBP, ABP, and echocardiography. A physician using a mercury-column sphygmomanometer performed three OBP measurements. The ABP was recorded using a noninvasive ambulatory monitor (mean, 35.4 awake readings per subject). Participants took HBP readings with an automatic, oscillometric device over a 10-week period (mean, 277.9 readings per subject). The left-ventricular mass index (LVMI) was calculated from measurements obtained from two-dimensionally guided M-mode or linear tracings on echocardiography. RESULTS: For systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP/DBP), the correlation coefficients of the LVMI with OBP, awake ABP, and HBP were 0.29/0.27, 0.41/0.26, and 0.47/0.35, respectively (all P < .01). In a multivariate regression analysis in which age, sex, body mass index, OBP, awake ABP, and HBP were included, only age, sex, and HBP were significant predictors of LVMI. When only the first 12 home readings were used, the superiority of HBP was no longer evident. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to OBP and ABP, HBP measurements, when averaged over a 10-week period, are independently related to LVMI. The HBP adds prognostic information over and above OBP and ABP in the prediction of cardiovascular end-organ damage, but this relationship appears to depend on the number of readings taken.",

The effects of an anger-provoking interview compared with a neutral interview on endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation assessed by brachial artery ultrasound were examined in 14 healthy subjects without coronary heart disease risk factors. The anger provocation condition, but not the neutral condition, caused a significant impairment in endothelium-dependent vasodilation at 90 minutes compared with baseline (p = 0.004) and 30 minutes (p = 0.013). Similarly, endothelium-independent vasodilation was significantly impaired at 90 minutes after the angry interview compared with baseline (p = 0.003) and 30 minutes (p = 0.001). The decreases in endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation were greater after the anger-provoking interview than after the neutral interview, especially between 30 and 90 minutes. In conclusion, preliminary results suggest that an episode of anger is associated with a dysregulation in endothelium-dependent and -independent pathways, suggesting that these mechanisms might contribute to the link between anger and coronary heart disease events.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ambulatory blood pressure is a better predictor of target organ damage and the risk of adverse cardiovascular events than office measurements. Whether this is due to the greater reliability owing to the larger number of measurements that are usually taken using ambulatory monitoring, or the greater validity of these measurements independent of the number, remains controversial. METHODS: We addressed this issue by comparing physician readings and ambulatory measurements as predictors of left ventricular mass index. The number of readings was controlled by using the average of three physician readings and randomly selecting three awake readings from a 24-h ambulatory recording. RESULTS: In a multiple regression analysis that included both the ambulatory and physician blood pressure measurements, only the ambulatory systolic measurements significantly predicted left ventricular mass index (B=0.37, t=3.11, P=0.002); the coefficient for physician's systolic measurements was essentially zero (B=-0.01, t=-0.26, NS). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the superiority of ambulatory blood pressure as a predictor of target organ damage, compared with physician measurements, cannot be adequately/fully explained by the impact of the larger number of measurements obtained with ambulatory monitoring.",

These include reduced effectiveness in generating a protective immune response in patients with extensive influenza exposure, safety concerns due to its live attenuated virus formulation, and reduced efficacy due to viral drift/shift. To address this limitation, we have developed a nanocomplex comprised of a mast cell (MC) agonist and toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand to adjuvant a broadly acting influenza antigen. The newly reported MC agonist was identified by screening mastoparan-7 analogs for MC degranulation activity, which led to a more active peptide analog, MP12W. Positively charged MP12W spontaneously forms nanoparticulate complexes (NPs) with CpG 1826 that were then used to intranasally vaccinate mice with a computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) hemagglutinin (HA) protein. The NPs were further optimized by substituting CpG 1826 with CpG 55.2, a TLR-9 agonist identified by machine learning to be more active in humans. MP12W-CpG 1826 NPs showed an increased pro-inflammatory response and decreased cytotoxicity in vitro compared to M7 complexes, translating into a safer profile in a model of increased hypersensitivity, collaborative cross mice 027 (CC027). Intranasal vaccination with this complex and broadly reactive HA resulted in higher mucosal antibody concentration and increased cytokine production with antigen recall. These responses were enhanced with MP12W-CpG 55.2 NP vaccination. MP12W-CpG NPs provided similar protection in an influenza challenge model. This study demonstrates the potential of this novel intranasal nanocomplex for vaccination.",

Bordetella pertussis infects the respiratory tract and caused 0.45% childhood mortality in the United States before implementing pertussis vaccines. Pertussis infections are resurging. Immunity induced by current pertussis vaccines wanes quickly, possibly due to vaccine-induced T helper (Th) 2 and weak mucosal immunity. B. pertussis induces Th1, Th17, and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immunity, providing durable protection against disease. Next-generation pertussis vaccines that induce Th1, Th17, and IgA immunity may reduce the resurgence of pertussis. This study determined if nasal pertussis vaccines adjuvanted with the mast cell activator compound 48/80 (C48/80) modulate pertussis-specific immunity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice received intranasal C48/80-adjuvanted pertussis vaccines or subcutaneous aluminum-adjuvanted pertussis vaccines. Immunized mice were challenged with B. pertussis and monitored for protection against infection. Pertussis-specific immune profiles were characterized after immunization. A C48/80 and CpG adjuvant combination was evaluated to enhance pertussis-specific Th1 immunity. RESULTS: Alum-adjuvanted pertussis vaccines induce Th2 immunity and undetectable IgA responses. Nasal C48/80-adjuvanted pertussis vaccines enhance pertussis-specific serum and mucosal IgA and Th2 and Th17 responses but not Th1 immunity. The C48/80 and CpG adjuvant combination enhances systemic and mucosal pertussis-specific Th1, Th17, and IgA compared to unadjuvanted pertussis vaccines, which may be the desired immune response to protect against pertussis infections. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that nasal pertussis vaccines containing C48/80 adjuvants induce pertussis-specific IgA, Th1-, and Th17-associated immunity when combined with CpG, which may be an effective strategy to improve pertussis vaccines.",

In this study, a next generation of broadly-reactive influenza hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines were developed using the Computationally Optimized Broadly Reactive Antigen (COBRA) methodology. These HA vaccines were formulated with Mastoparan 7 (M7-NH2) mast cell degranulating peptide adjuvant and administered intranasally to determine vaccine-induced seroconversion of antibodies against a panel of influenza viruses and protection following infection with H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in mice. Mice vaccinated intranasally with M7-NH2-adjuvanted COBRA HA vaccines had high HAIs against a panel of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and were protected against both morbidity and mortality, with reduced viral lung titers, following challenge with an H1N1 influenza virus. Additionally, M7-NH2 adjuvanted COBRA HA vaccines induced Th2 skewed immune responses with robust IgG and isotype antibodies in the serum and mucosal lung lavages. Overall, this intranasally delivered M7-NH2 -adjuvanted COBRA HA vaccine provides effective protection against drifted H1N1 and H3N2 viruses.",

Several polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives can be obtained depending on the number of moles of ethylene oxide (EO). HCO ethoxylates have the potential to cause anaphylactoid reactions. There is little published information about these types of reactions in dogs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential for HCO-ethoxylate-containing drugs to cause anaphylactoid reactions in dogs, employing intradermal testing (IDT) with various concentrations of HCO ethoxylates (HCO-25, -40, -60 and -80). ANIMALS: Four healthy male laboratory dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed IDT with drugs containing HCO ethoxylates and HCO ethoxylates alone to determine threshold concentrations. The IDT scores and threshold concentrations were compared. Analysis of skin biopsies from IDT sites was used to measure the percentage of degranulated mast cells. The effect of histamine at IDT sites was investigated by pre-treatment with an antihistamine. RESULTS: All HCO-ethoxylate-containing drugs caused a wheal-and-flare reaction. The threshold concentrations (0.001% and 0.00001%) of each HCO-ethoxylate depended on the number of moles of EO (p < 0.05). Mast cell degranulation was enhanced by all HCO ethoxylates. The HCO-60-induced reaction was suppressed by an oral antihistamine. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The threshold concentration can serve as a consideration for developing safe new drug formulations and for clinical decision-making around using drugs containing PEG derivatives. IDT is useful to predict the risk of adverse effects. Antihistamines could demonstrate a prophylactic effect.",

Sensory neurons are afferent neurons innervating most areas of the body but especially in the periphery, where they sense external and internal signals and relay information to the brain. The significance of MC-sensory neuron communication is now increasingly becoming recognized, especially because both cell types are in close physical proximity at the host-environment interface and around major organs of the body and produce specific mediators that can activate each other. In this review, we explore the roles of MC-sensory neuron crosstalk in allergic diseases, shedding light on how activated MCs trigger sensory neurons to initiate signaling in pruritus, shock, and potentially abdominal pain in allergy, and how activated sensory neurons regulate MCs in homeostasis and atopic dermatitis associated with contact hypersensitivity and type 2 inflammation. Throughout the review, we also discuss how these 2 sentinel cell types signal each other, potentially resulting in a positive feedback loop that can sustain inflammation. Unraveling the mysteries of MC-sensory neuron crosstalk is likely to unveil their critical roles in various disease conditions and enable the development of new therapeutic approaches to combat these maladies.",

Here we found that antigen (Ag)-triggered degranulation of IgE-sensitized mast cells (MCs) was mediated by NLRP3 and ASC. IgE-Ag stimulated NEK7 and Pyk2 kinases in MCs to induce the deposition of NLRP3 and ASC on granules and form a distinct protein complex (granulosome) that chaperoned the granules to the cell surface. MCs deficient in NLRP3 or ASC did not form granulosomes, degranulated poorly in vitro and did not evoke systemic anaphylaxis in mice. IgE-Ag-triggered anaphylaxis was prevented by an NLRP3 inhibitor. In endotoxin-primed MCs, pro-IL-1β was rapidly packaged into granules after IgE-Ag stimulation and processed within granule remnants by proteases after degranulation, causing lethal anaphylaxis in mice. During IgE-Ag-mediated degranulation of endotoxin-primed MCs, granulosomes promoted degranulation, combined with exteriorization and processing of IL-1β, resulting in severe inflammation.",

Many are recurrent (rUTI), with patients frequently experiencing chronic pelvic pain and urinary frequency despite clearance of bacteriuria after antibiotics. To elucidate the basis for these bacteria-independent bladder symptoms, we examined the bladders of patients with rUTI. We noticed a notable increase in neuropeptide content in the lamina propria and indications of enhanced nociceptive activity. In mice subjected to rUTI, we observed sensory nerve sprouting that was associated with nerve growth factor (NGF) produced by recruited monocytes and tissue-resident mast cells. Treatment of rUTI mice with an NGF-neutralizing antibody prevented sprouting and alleviated pelvic sensitivity, whereas instillation of native NGF into naïve mice bladders mimicked nerve sprouting and pain behavior. Nerve activation, pain, and urinary frequency were each linked to the presence of proximal mast cells, because mast cell deficiency or treatment with antagonists against receptors of several direct or indirect mast cell products was each effective therapeutically. Thus, our findings suggest that NGF-driven sensory sprouting in the bladder coupled with chronic mast cell activation represents an underlying mechanism driving bacteria-independent pain and voiding defects experienced by patients with rUTI.",

Pharmacologically suppressing MCs via the inhibition of the ORAI1 Ca2+ channel may represent a potential strategy for preventing anaphylaxis. This study demonstrated that peanut-induced anaphylaxis in sensitized mice resulted in significant hypothermia and acute diarrhea. Utilizing the Mcpt5cre-DTA mouse model, we demonstrated that this anaphylactic response was mediated by IgE-antigen-induced MC activation. Prophylactic administration of MC suppressors was an effective means of preventing peanut-induced anaphylaxis. In addition, we observed the potent efficacy of an ORAI1 inhibitor in suppressing the FcεRI-mediated response of murine or human MCs, even when administered concurrently or post-allergen exposure. Mechanistically, the ORAI1 inhibitor was found to prevent the association of Synaptotagmin-2 with the SNARE complex. In an in vivo mouse model of peanut-induced anaphylaxis, the administration of the ORAI1 inhibitor after allergen challenge effectively suppressed allergic acute diarrhea and ameliorated anaphylaxis. Therefore, pharmacological intervention of ORAI1 channel inhibition in MCs represents a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of peanut-induced anaphylaxis and acute diarrhea in vivo.",

                  "abstract": "There is a growing consensus that a significant proportion of recurrent urinary tract infections are linked to the persistence of uropathogens within the urinary tract and their re-emergence upon the conclusion of antibiotic treatment. Studies in mice and human have revealed that uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) can persist in bladder epithelial cells (BECs) even after the apparent resolution of the infection. Here, we found that, following the entry of UPEC into RAB27b+ fusiform vesicles in BECs, some bacteria escaped into the cytoplasmic compartment via a mechanism involving hemolysin A (HlyA). However, these UPEC were immediately recaptured within LC3A/B+ autophagosomes that matured into LAMP1+ autolysosomes. Thereafter, HlyA+ UPEC-containing lysosomes failed to acidify, which is an essential step for bacterial elimination. This lack of acidification was related to the inability of bacteria-harboring compartments to recruit V-ATPase proton pumps, which was attributed to the defragmentation of cytosolic microtubules by HlyA. The persistence of UPEC within LAMP1+ compartments in BECs appears to be directly linked to HlyA. Thus, through intravesicular instillation of microtubule stabilizer, this host defense response can be co-opted to reduce intracellular bacterial burden following UTIs in the bladder potentially preventing recurrence.",

Although MCs are essential to the healthy immune response, their overactivity and pathological states can lead to numerous health hazards. The side effect of mast cell activity is usually caused by degranulation. It can be triggered by immunological factors, such as immunoglobulins, lymphocytes, or antigen-antibody complexes, and non-immune factors, such as radiation and pathogens. An intensive reaction of mast cells can even lead to anaphylaxis, one of the most life-threatening allergic reactions. What is more, mast cells play a role in the tumor microenvironment by modulating various events of tumor biology, such as cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis. The mechanisms of the mast cell actions are still poorly understood, making it difficult to develop therapies for their pathological condition. This review focuses on the possible therapies targeting mast cell degranulation, anaphylaxis, and MC-derived tumors.",

Anaphylaxis is triggered when blood-borne allergens activate IgE-bound perivascular mast cells (MCs) throughout the body, causing an extensive systemic release of MC mediators. Through precipitating vasodilatation and vascular leakage, these mediators are believed to trigger a sharp drop in blood pressure in humans and in core body temperature in animals. We report that the IgE/MC-mediated drop in body temperature in mice associated with anaphylaxis also requires the body's thermoregulatory neural circuit. This circuit is activated when granule-borne chymase from MCs is deposited on proximal TRPV1+ sensory neurons and stimulates them via protease-activated receptor-1. This triggers the activation of the body's thermoregulatory neural network, which rapidly attenuates brown adipose tissue thermogenesis to cause hypothermia. Mice deficient in either chymase or TRPV1 exhibited limited IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, and, in wild-type mice, anaphylaxis could be recapitulated simply by systemically activating TRPV1+ sensory neurons. Thus, in addition to their well-known effects on the vasculature, MC products, especially chymase, promote IgE-mediated anaphylaxis by activating the thermoregulatory neural circuit.",

Several mast cell activating (MCA) compounds have been reported such as M7 and Compound 48/80 (C48/80). While these MCAs have been proven to be efficacious vaccine adjuvants, their translatability is limited by batch-to-batch variability, challenging large-scale manufacturing, and poor in vivo stability for the M7 peptide. Due to this, high throughput screening was performed to identify small molecule MCAs. Several potent MCAs were identified via this screening, but the in vivo translatability of the compounds was limited due to their poor aqueous solubility. To enhance the delivery of these MCAs we encapsulated them in acetalated dextran (Ace-DEX) microparticles (MPs). We have previously utilized Ace-DEX MPs for vaccine delivery due to their passive targeting to phagocytic cells, acid sensitivity, and tunable degradation. Four different MCA loaded MPs were combined with West Nile Virus Envelope III protein (EDIII) and their vaccine adjuvant activities were compared in vivo. MPs containing the small molecule MCA ST101036 produced the highest anti-EDIII IgG titers of all the MCAs tested. Further, ST101036 MPs produced higher titers than ST101036 formulated with PEG as a cosolvent which highlights the benefit of Ace-DEX MPs over a conventional formulation technique. Finally, in a mouse model of West Nile Virus infection ST101036 MPs produced similar survival to soluble M7 (80-90%). Overall, these data show that ST101036 MPs produce a robust antibody response against EDIII and survival emphasizing the benefits of using Ace-DEX as a delivery platform for the poorly soluble ST101036.",

Mast cells (MCs) are emerging as a target for a new class of mucosal vaccine adjuvants. Here, we developed and characterized a nanoparticulate adjuvant composed of an MC activator [mastoparan-7 (M7)] and a TLR ligand (CpG). This novel nanoparticle (NP) adjuvant was co-formulated with a computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) for hemagglutinin (HA), which is broadly reactive against influenza strains. M7 was combined at different ratios with CpG and tested for in vitro immune responses and cytotoxicity. We observed significantly higher cytokine production in dendritic cells and MCs with the lowest cytotoxicity at a charge-neutralizing ratio of nitrogen/phosphate = 1 for M7 and CpG. This combination formed spherical NPs approximately 200 nm in diameter with self-assembling capacity. Mice were vaccinated intranasally with COBRA HA and M7-CpG NPs in a prime-boost-boost schedule. Vaccinated mice had significantly higher antigen-specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) in serum and mucosa compared with controls. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice had significantly increased cytokine production upon antigen recall and the presence of central and effector memory T cells in draining lymph nodes. Finally, co-immunization with NPs and COBRA HA induced influenza H3N2-specific HA inhibition antibody titers across multiple strains and partially protected mice from a challenge against an H3N2 virus. These results illustrate that the M7-CpG NP adjuvant combination can induce a protective immune response with a broadly reactive influenza antigen via mucosal vaccination.",

It is not known what factors regulate regranulation, let alone if regranulation occurs in vivo. We report that mice can undergo multiple bouts of MC regranulation following successive anaphylactic reactions. mTORC1, a nutrient sensor that activates protein and lipid synthesis, is necessary for regranulation. mTORC1 activity is regulated by a glucose-6-phosphate transporter, Slc37a2, which increases intracellular glucose-6-phosphate and ATP during regranulation, two upstream signals of mTOR. Additionally, Slc37a2 concentrates extracellular metabolites within endosomes, which are trafficked into nascent granules. Thus, the metabolic switch associated with MC regranulation is mediated by the interactions of a cellular metabolic sensor and a transporter of extracellular metabolites into MC granules.",

Because persistent uropathogens are intracellular, they are often refractive to antibiotic treatment. The recent discovery of endogenous Lactobacillus spp. in the bladders of healthy humans raised the question of whether these endogenous bacteria directly or indirectly impact intracellular bacterial burden in the bladder. Here, we report that in contrast to healthy women, female patients experiencing recurrent UTIs have a bladder population of Lactobacilli that is markedly reduced. Exposing infected human BECs to L. crispatus in vitro markedly reduced the intracellular uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) load. The adherence of Lactobacilli to BECs was found to result in increased type I interferon (IFN) production, which in turn enhanced the expression of cathepsin D within lysosomes harboring UPECs. This lysosomal cathepsin D-mediated UPEC killing was diminished in germ-free mice and type I IFN receptor-deficient mice. Secreted metabolites of L. crispatus seemed to be responsible for the increased expression of type I IFN in human BECs. Intravesicular administration of Lactobacilli into UPEC-infected murine bladders markedly reduced their intracellular bacterial load suggesting that components of the endogenous microflora can have therapeutic effects against UTIs.",

Currently, most vaccine studies, including those in humans, involve parenteral vaccination aimed at evoking and sustaining elevated levels of systemic antibody directed at the uropathogens. In view of recent reports of aberrant Th2-biased bladder immune responses to infection, we hypothesized that immunizing mice intravesically with antigens from uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) combined with a Th1-skewing adjuvant could correct this defect and promote protection against UTIs. Here we report that compared with mice immunized subcutaneously with this vaccine combination, intravesically immunized mice were markedly more protected from UTIs because of their distinctive ability to recruit Th1 cells into the bladder. This mode of vaccination was effective even in mice that experienced multiple UTIs and displayed pronounced aberrant bladder immune responses. Thus, intravesical vaccination with one or more UPEC antigens to induce bladder Th1 responses represents a superior strategy to combat UTIs, especially in UTI-prone subjects.",

However, small molecule mast cell activators may be a more cost-efficient adjuvant alternative that is easily synthesized with high purity compared to M7 or C48/80. To identify novel mast cell activating compounds that could be evaluated for mucosal vaccine adjuvant activity, we employed high-throughput screening to assess over 55,000 small molecules for mast cell degranulation activity. Fifteen mast cell activating compounds were down-selected to five compounds based on in vitro immune activation activities including cytokine production and cellular cytotoxicity, synthesis feasibility, and selection for functional diversity. These small molecule mast cell activators were evaluated for in vivo adjuvant activity and induction of protective immunity against West Nile Virus infection in BALB/c mice when combined with West Nile Virus envelope domain III (EDIII) protein in a nasal vaccine. We found that three of the five mast cell activators, ST101036, ST048871, and R529877, evoked high levels of EDIII-specific antibody and conferred comparable levels of protection against WNV challenge. The level of protection provided by these small molecule mast cell activators was comparable to the protection evoked by M7 (67%) but markedly higher than the levels seen with mice immunized with EDIII alone (no adjuvant 33%). Thus, novel small molecule mast cell activators identified by high throughput screening are as efficacious as previously described mast cell activators when used as nasal vaccine adjuvants and represent next-generation mast cell activators for evaluation in mucosal vaccine studies.",

Since DENV is a human pathogen, we sought to ascertain whether a similar phenomenon could occur in humans by characterizing the products released by human MCs (huMCs) upon direct (antibody-independent) DENV exposure, using the phenotypically mature huMC line, ROSA. DENV did not productively infect huMCs but prompted huMC release of proteases and eicosanoids and induced a Th1-polarized transcriptional profile. In co-culture and trans-well systems, huMC products activated human microvascular endothelial cells, involving transcription of vasoactive mediators and increased monolayer permeability. This permeability was blocked by MC-stabilizing drugs, or limited by drugs targeting certain MC products. Thus, MC stabilizers are a viable strategy to limit MC-promoted vascular leakage during DENV infection in humans.",

However, the latter was associated with significant long-term complications. To provide a new candidate of possible surgical solution for bladder dysfunction, we propose a novel orthotropic mouse bladder transplantation model. The donor bladder with abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava was isolated and orthotopically sutured to the recipient, whose bladder above the ureteral opening level was removed. The recipient mice showed more than 80% 6-month survival rate and comparable body weight to control mice. At both 1 month and 6 months posttransplant, the urine voiding behavior of recipient mice and control mice was monitored by cystometry. We found that the recipient mice displayed similar bladder pressure and urine secretion ability compared to control mice especially at 6 months posttransplant. Similarity of bladder structure between recipient and control mice was confirmed by histology. As a proof of principle, we tested our model in an allogeneic setting. Early acute rejection was noted after day 5 that was histologically more profound by day 10 posttransplant. These results indicate that the mouse bladder transplant is able to provide normal bladder function.",

We found that, following each bladder infection, a highly T helper type 2 (TH2)-skewed immune response directed at bladder re-epithelialization is observed, with limited capacity to clear infection. This response is initiated by a distinct subset of CD301b+OX40L+ dendritic cells, which migrate into the bladder epithelium after infection before trafficking to lymph nodes to preferentially activate TH2 cells. The bladder epithelial repair response is cumulative and aberrant as, after multiple infections, the epithelium was markedly thickened and bladder capacity was reduced relative to controls.

                  "abstract": "Recently a G-protein-coupled receptor, MAS Related GPR Family Member X2 (MRGPRX2), was identified as a specific receptor on human mast cells responsible for IgE independent adverse drug reactions (ADR). Although a murine homologue, Mrgprb2, has been identified for this receptor, its affinity for many ADR-causing drugs is poor making it difficult to undertake in vivo studies to examine mechanisms of ADR and to develop therapeutic strategies. Here, we have created humanized mice capable of generating MRGPRX2-expressing human MCs allowing for the study of MRGPRX2 MCs-mediated ADR in vitro as well as in vivo. Humanized mice were generated by hydrodynamic-injection of plasmids expressing human GM-CSF and IL-3 into NOD-scid IL2R-γ-/- strain of mice that had been transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells. These GM/IL-3 humice expressed high numbers of tissue human MCs but the MRGPRX2 receptor expressed in MCs were limited to few body sites including the skin. Importantly, large numbers of MRGPRX2-expressing human MCs could be cultured from the bone marrow of GM/IL-3 humice revealing these mice to be an important source of human MCs for in vitro studies of MRGPRX2-related MCs activities. When GM/IL-3 humice were exposed to known ADR causing contrast agents (meglumine and gadobutrol), the humice were found to experience anaphylaxis analogous to the clinical situation. Thus, GM/IL-3 humice represent a valuable model for investigating in vivo interactions of ADR-causing drugs and human MCs and their sequelae, and these mice are also a source of human MRGPRX2-expressing MCs for in vitro studies.",

Our studies originated from the observation of microvascular platelet retention in a rat cardiac surgery model. Ensuing work supported the proximity of platelet aggregates with perivascular mast cells (MCs) and demonstrated that platelet activation triggered systemic MC activation. We then identified platelet activating factor (PAF) as the platelet-derived mediator stimulating MCs and, using chimeric animals with platelets defective in PAF generation or MCs lacking PAF receptor, defined the role of this platelet-MC interaction for vascular leakage, shock, and tissue inflammation. In application of these findings, we demonstrated that inhibition of platelet activation in modeled cardiac surgery blunted MC-dependent inflammation and tissue injury. Together, our work identifies a previously undefined mechanism of inflammatory augmentation, in which platelets trigger local and systemic responses through activation of perivascular MCs.",

Their presence in mucosal tissues and skin make them one of the first immune cells to make contact with incoming pathogens. MCs can be readily activated at infection sites and release their collection of prestored and de novo synthesized mediators to initiate immune responses. Additionally, since MCs are in close proximity to blood vessels, they help to augment immune cell mobilization from the circulation to the infection site. However, not all MC reactions are beneficial, and if MCs become overactivated, as is observed with chronic or systemic infections, pathogenic sequelae ensue. In view of the powerful immunomodulatory role of MCs, there is growing interest in targeting these cells to either boost immunity or diminish harmful inflammatory outcomes of severe or chronic infection.",

This study aimed to determine if mucosal vaccination using a modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 (MVAgp120) prime and a HIV-1 gp120 protein boost could be optimized to induce serum antibody responses similar to those induced by an intramuscularly (i.m.) administered MVAgp120 prime/gp120 boost to allow comparison of an i.m. immunization regimen to a mucosal vaccination regimen for the ability to protect against a low-dose rectal simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge. A 3-fold higher antigen dose was required for intranasal (i.n.) immunization with gp120 to induce serum anti-gp120 IgG responses not significantly different than those induced by i.m. immunization. gp120 fused to the adenovirus type 2 fiber binding domain (gp120-Ad2F), a mucosal targeting ligand, exhibited enhanced i.n. immunogenicity compared to gp120. MVAgp120 was more immunogenic after i.n. delivery than after gastric or rectal delivery. Using these optimized vaccines, an i.n. MVAgp120 prime/combined i.m. (gp120) and i.n. (gp120-Ad2F) boost regimen (i.n./i.m.-plus-i.n.) induced serum anti-gp120 antibody titers similar to those induced by the intramuscular prime/boost regimen (i.m./i.m.) in rabbits and nonhuman primates. Despite the induction of similar systemic anti-HIV-1 antibody responses, neither the i.m./i.m. nor the i.n./i.m.-plus-i.n. regimen protected against a repeated low-dose rectal SHIV challenge. These results demonstrate that immunization regimens utilizing the i.n. route are able to induce serum antigen-specific antibody responses similar to those induced by systemic immunization.IMPORTANCE Mucosal vaccination is proposed as a method of immunization able to induce protection against mucosal pathogens that is superior to protection provided by parenteral immunization. However, mucosal vaccination often induces serum antigen-specific immune responses of lower magnitude than those induced by parenteral immunization, making the comparison of mucosal and parenteral immunization difficult. We identified vaccine parameters that allowed an immunization regimen consisting of an i.n. prime followed by boosters administered by both i.n. and i.m. routes to induce serum antibody responses similar to those induced by i.m. prime/boost vaccination. Additional studies are needed to determine the potential benefit of mucosal immunization for HIV-1 and other mucosally transmitted pathogens.",

Many currently known MC activators are inadequate for in vivo applications, however, and research on identifying novel MC activators is limited. In this study, we identified novel MC activators by using high-throughput screening (HTS) assays using approximately 55,000 small molecules. Data sets obtained by the primary HTS assays were statistically evaluated using quality control rules and the B-score calculation, and compounds with B-scores of >3.0 were chosen as mast cell activators (hits). These hits were re-evaluated with secondary and tertiary HTS assays, followed by further statistical analysis. From these hits, we selected 15 compounds that caused degranulation in murine and human MCs, with potential for flexible chemical modification for further study. Among these 15 compounds, ST101036, ST029248, and ST026567 exhibited higher degranulation potency than other hit compounds in both human and mouse MCs. In addition, the 15 compounds identified promote de novo synthesis of cytokines and induce the release of eicosanoids from human and mouse MCs. HTS enabled us to identify small-molecule MC activators with unique properties that may be useful as vaccine adjuvants.",

Mastoparan functions by activating connective tissue MCs (CTMCs) via the MRGPRX2 (Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member X2) receptor. Peripheral CTMC activation, in turn, enhances recruitment of bacteria-clearing neutrophils and wound-healing CD301b+ dendritic cells. Consistent with MCs playing a master coordinating role, MC activation also augmented migration of various antigen-presenting dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes, leading to stronger protection against a second infection challenge. MCAs therefore orchestrate both the innate and adaptive immune arms, which could potentially be applied to combat peripheral infections by a broad range of pathogens.",

Several theories have been put forth regarding the pathogenesis of CSU with much evidence pointing toward a potential autoimmune etiology in up to 50% of patients with this condition. In this review, we highlight the evidence surrounding the autoimmune pathogenesis of chronic urticaria including recent data which suggests that CSU may involve contributions from both immunoglobin G (IgG)-specific and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-specific autoantibodies against a vast array of antigens that can span beyond those found on the surface of mast cells and basophils.",

Here, we describe the existence of a CD301b+ perivascular dendritic cell (DC) subset that continuously samples blood and relays antigens to neighboring MCs, which vigorously degranulate and trigger anaphylaxis. DC antigen transfer involves the active discharge of surface-associated antigens on 0.5- to 1.0-micrometer microvesicles (MVs) generated by vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4). Antigen sharing by DCs is not limited to MCs, as neighboring DCs also acquire antigen-bearing MVs.

The bubonic stage of the Y. pestis life cycle precedes septicemia, which is facilitated by trafficking of infected mononuclear phagocytes through these buboes. However, how Y. pestis convert these immunocytes recruited by host to contain the pathogen into vehicles for bacterial dispersal and the role of immune cell death in this context are unknown. We show that the lymphatic spread requires Yersinia outer protein J (YopJ), which triggers death of infected macrophages by downregulating a suppressor of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1-mediated (RIPK1-mediated) cell death programs. The YopJ-triggered cell death was identified as necroptotic, which released intracellular bacteria, allowing them to infect new neighboring cell targets. Dying macrophages also produced chemotactic sphingosine 1-phosphate, enhancing cell-to-cell contact, further promoting infection. This necroptosis-driven expansion of infected macrophages in buboes maximized the number of bacteria-bearing macrophages reaching secondary lymph nodes, leading to sepsis. In support, necrostatins confined bacteria within macrophages and protected mice from lethal infection. These findings define necrotization of buboes as a mechanism for bacterial spread and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

Antibodies against JEV enhanced DENV replication; however, JEV immunity was protective in vivo during secondary DENV1 infection, promoting rapid gains in antibody avidity. Mechanistically, JEV immunity activated dendritic cells and effector memory T cells, which developed a T follicular helper cell phenotype in draining lymph nodes upon secondary DENV1 infection. We identified cross-reactive epitopes that promote recall from a pool of flavivirus serocomplex cross-reactive memory CD4 T cells and confirmed that a similar serocomplex cross-reactive immunity occurs in humans.

Subcellular trafficking typically involves multiple Rabs, with each specific step mediated by a distinct Rab protein. We describe a collaboration between two distinct Rab-protein-orchestrated trafficking circuits in bladder epithelial cells (BECs) that expels intracellular uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) from their intracellular niche. RAB11a and RAB27b and their trafficking circuitry are simultaneously involved in UPEC expulsion. While RAB11a recruits its effector RAB11FIP3 and cytoskeletal motor Dynein, RAB27b mobilizes the effector MyRIP and motor Myosin VIIa to mediate bacterial expulsion. This collaboration is coordinated by deposition of the exocyst complex on bacteria-containing vesicles, an event triggered by the innate receptor Toll-like receptor 4. Both RAB11a and RAB27b are recruited and activated by the exocyst complex components SEC6/SEC15. Thus, the cell autonomous defense system can mobilize and coalesce multiple subcellular trafficking circuitries to combat infections.",

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a microbial disease reported worldwide. Women are particularly susceptible with many suffering debilitating recurrent (r) infections. Treatment is by antibiotics, but such therapy is linked to antibiotic resistance and re-infection. This study explored the innate protective mechanisms of the urogenital tract with the aim of boosting such defences therapeutically. Modelling UTIs in vitro, human vaginal and bladder epithelial cells were challenged with uropathogenic Escherichia coli (CFT073) and microbial PAMPs including flagellin, LPS and peptidoglycan. Flagellin functioning via the TLR5/NFκB pathway was identified as the key UPEC virulence factor causing a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the production of the host-defence peptide (HDP), BD2. BD2-depleted urine samples from bladder infected mice supported increased UPEC growth, strengthening the significance of the HDPs in protecting the urogenital tissues from infection. Clinically, vaginal-douche BD2 concentrations were reduced (p < 0.05) in women suffering rUTIs, compared to age-matched healthy controls with concentrations further decreased (p < 0.05) in a TLR5392Stop SNP rUTI subgroup. Topical vaginal estrogen treatment increased (p < 0.001) BD2 concentrations in all women, including those carrying the SNP. These data identify therapeutic and antibiotic sparing roles for vaginal immunomodulatory agents that specifically target HDP induction, facilitate bacterial killing and disrupt the UPEC infection cycle.",

However, the factors that trigger epithelial cell proliferation in this inflammatory process are incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-27 is rapidly and transiently produced by CD301b+ cells in the skin after injury. The functional role of IL-27 and CD301b+ cells is demonstrated by the finding that CD301b-depleted mice exhibit delayed wound closure in vivo, which could be rescued by topical IL-27 treatment. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the IL-27 receptor (Il27Ra-/-) attenuates wound healing, suggesting an essential role for IL-27 signaling in skin regeneration in vivo. Mechanistically, IL-27 feeds back on keratinocytes to stimulate cell proliferation and re-epithelialization in the skin, whereas IL-27 leads to suppression of keratinocyte terminal differentiation. Finally, we identify that IL-27 potently increases expression of the antiviral oligoadenylate synthetase 2, but does not affect expression of antibacterial human beta defensin 2 or regenerating islet-derived protein 3-alpha. Together, our data suggest a previously unrecognized role for IL-27 in regulating epithelial cell proliferation and antiviral host defense during the normal wound healing response.",

Indeed, up to 40% of women will experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) during their lifetime. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) contribute to an overwhelming majority of these cases and they typically initiate UTIs by invading the superficial epithelium that lines the bladder lumen. In addition to serving as an effective barrier to noxious agents found in urine, bladder epithelial cells (BECs) play a key physiological role in regulating bladder volume to accommodate urine flow. UPEC appear to coopt this latter property to circumvent this normally impregnable epithelial barrier. However, in spite of this shortcoming, recent studies suggest that BECs possess several immune mechanisms to combat bacterial invasion including expulsion of invading bacteria back into the bladder lumen following infection. These antibacterial activities of BECs are triggered and coordinated by sensory molecules located on the epithelial cell membrane and within the cells. Although, they are the primary targets of microbial attack, BECs appear to be equipped with a diverse repertoire of defense schemes to fend off many of these microbial challenges.",

Prolonged interaction of mast cells with pathogens and their associated pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as in a chronically inflamed tissue, could shape mast cell-directed immune responses. Mast cells secrete a wide variety of chemoattractants and cytokines that promote leukocyte trafficking to sites of infection, where they can contribute to pathogen clearance or amplify inflammation by secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. In a mouse model of dengue infection, mast cells upregulate the chemokines CX3CL1, CXCL12, and CCL5. This role of mast cells to recruit appropriate pathogen-clearing immune cells to sites of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections is arguably the most important innate immune activity mediated by these immune surveillance cells. Mast cells are well known effectors of adaptive immunity by binding immunoglobulin through their Fc receptors. The best known instance of this is in IgE-mediated immunity against helminth parasites.",

MCs were responding to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secreted by BECs after inflammasome and caspase-1 signaling. Upon uptake of granule-associated chymase (mouse MC protease 4 [mMCPT4]), BECs underwent caspase-1-associated cytolysis and exfoliation.

Here, we developed a murine model of passive anaphylaxis with demonstrated MC involvement and an in vitro assay to evaluate the effect of DS on MCs. In contrast with previous reports, we determined that functional IgE remains on the cell surface of desensitized MCs following DS. Despite notable reductions in MC degranulation following DS, the high-affinity IgE receptor FcεRI was still capable of transducing signals in desensitized MCs. Additionally, we found that displacement of the actin cytoskeleton and its continued association with FcεRI impede the capacity of desensitized MCs to evoke the calcium response that is essential for MC degranulation. Together, these findings suggest that reduced degranulation responses in desensitized MCs arise from aberrant actin remodeling, providing insights that may lead to improvement of DS treatments for anaphylactic responses.",

Using IL-13-reporter mice to fate-map cytokine-expressing cells in vivo, this study reveals that thymic iNKT cells express IL-13 early during development, and this IL-13-expressing intermediate gives rise to mature iNKT1, iNKT2, and iNKT17 subsets. IL-4 and IL-13 reporter mice also reveal that effector iNKT2 cells produce IL-4 but little IL-13 in settings of type-2 inflammation. The preferential production of IL-4 over IL-13 in iNKT2 cells results in part from their reduced GATA-3 expression. In summary, this work helps integrate current models of iNKT cell development, and further establishes non-coordinate production of IL-4 and IL-13 as the predominant pattern of type-2 cytokine expression among innate cells in vivo.",

Because of its close proximity to the gut, the lower UT is constantly exposed to a barrage of gut bacteria. However, the bladder remains for the most part free of infection. The resistance of the bladder to active microbial colonization is due to both anatomical design as well as secreted antimicrobial compounds of the urothelium. The apical face of the urothelium is covered by uroplakin plaques and is coated by mucus, which discourages adherence and invasion of most microorganisms (1, 2). Because of its role in storing urine for extended periods of time, the urothelium of the bladder has an additional role in protecting the underlying tissue from urine and its many toxic constituents. Since the bladder and urinary system as a whole need to constantly maintain the integrity of the urothelium, immune responses in the UT are often tightly regulated to minimize the extent of damage by quelling inflammation in a timely manner.",

We have identified the existence of a broadly immunosuppressive transcriptional program associated with the bladder, but not the kidneys, during infection of the urinary tract that is dependent on bladder mast cells. This involves the localized secretion of IL-10 and results in the suppression of humoral immune responses in the bladder.

This resistance to infection is mainly ascribed to the versatility of the innate immune defences in the urinary tract, as the adaptive immune responses are limited particularly when only the lower urinary tract is infected. In recent years, as the strengths and weaknesses of the immune system of the urinary tract have emerged and as the virulence attributes of uropathogens are recognized, several potentially effective and unconventional strategies to contain or prevent urinary tract infections have emerged.",

These programs are activated by pathogen-associated pattern molecules and by various strategies intracellular pathogens employ to alter cellular microenvironments. Here, we show that, when uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) infect bladder epithelial cells (BECs), they are targeted by autophagy but avoid degradation because of their capacity to neutralize lysosomal pH. This change is detected by mucolipin TRP channel 3 (TRPML3), a transient receptor potential cation channel localized to lysosomes. TRPML3 activation then spontaneously initiates lysosome exocytosis, resulting in expulsion of exosome-encased bacteria. These studies reveal a cellular default system for lysosome homeostasis that has been co-opted by the autonomous defense program to clear recalcitrant pathogens.",

Retention of multiple subsets of phagocytes within peripheral LNs using the S1P receptor agonist FTY720 or S1P1-specific agonist SEW2871 increased survival, reduced colonization of downstream LNs, and limited progression to transmission-associated septicemic or pneumonic disease states. Conditional deletion of S1P1 in mononuclear phagocytes abolished node-to-node trafficking of infected cells. Thus, Y. pestis-orchestrated LN remodeling promoted its dissemination via host cells through the lymphatic system but can be blocked by prevention of leukocyte egress from DLNs.

METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the role of mast cells in pulmonary allograft rejection using an orthotopic rat pulmonary allograft model that utilizes chronic aspiration of gastric fluid to reliably obtain OB. Pulmonary allograft recipients (n = 35) received chronic aspiration of gastric fluid with (n = 10) and without (n = 16) treatment with a mast cell membrane stabilizer, cromolyn sodium, or chronic aspiration with normal saline (n = 9) as a control. RESULTS: The acute graft injury associated with long ischemic time in the model (6 hours total ischemic time; typical acute graft injury rate ~30%) was apparently blocked by cromolyn, because peri-operative mortality associated with the acute graft injury was not observed in any of the animals receiving cromolyn (p = 0.045). Further, the rats receiving cromolyn developed significantly fewer OB lesions than those treated with gastric fluid alone (p < 0.001), with a mean reduction of 46% of the airways affected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide impetus for further studies aimed at elucidating the effects of cromolyn and the role of mast cells in pulmonary allotransplantation.",

Species-specific fimbrial adhesins may be viewed as direct mediators of bidirectional signalling between bacteria and host cells. Understanding of this process has been highly informative for the design of novel strategies to modulate these signalling pathways and to curb bacterial infections and their harmful sequelae. Development of mixtures of inhibitors or a polyvalent inhibitor is under investigation, since many infectious agents express multiple specificities. Multiple molecular mechanisms of adhesion are required to initiate infection, and effective anti-adhesion strategies will need to address both bacterial and host site particularities.",

This does not explain, however, the rapid dissemination of the pathogen after it breaches the gut. In our study, S. Typhimurium suppressed degranulation of local mast cells (MCs), resulting in limited neutrophil recruitment and restricting outflow of vascular contents into infection sites, thus facilitating bacterial spread. MC suppression was mediated by secreted effector protein (SptP), which shares structural homology with Yersinia YopH. SptP functioned by dephosphorylating the vesicle fusion protein N-ethylmalemide-sensitive factor and by blocking phosphorylation of Syk. Without SptP, orally challenged S. Typhimurium failed to suppress MC degranulation and exhibited limited colonization of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Administration of SptP to sites of E. coli infection markedly enhanced its virulence. Thus, SptP-mediated inactivation of local MCs is a powerful mechanism utilized by S. Typhimurium to impede early innate immunity.",

Accordingly, basic principles that govern the interaction of bacterial adhesins to their cognate receptors on animal cells are presented, such as fimbriae as adhesin structures. Significantly, we discuss the types of receptor-adhesin relationship, the phenomenon of multiple adhesins each specific for distinct receptors produced by pathogenic clones, the identity of glycoconjugates as receptors for lectins that serve as adhesins, and the interaction of bacterial adhesins with the extracellular matrix on animal tissues. Finally, a specific section is devoted to recent developments in preventing or treating infections by blocking bacterial adhesion to animal cells. In this context, a review of the different approaches of antiadhesion therapy is discussed, including the use of receptor and adhesin analogs, dietary constituents, sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics, and adhesin-based vaccines. A discussion and summary of these topics focus on the in vivo data, including human trials, whereby plant extracts are used as a source of antiadhesion agents to prevent or treat urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and infectious gastritis or peptic ulcer diseases induced by Helicobacter pylori and to maintain oral health.",

Mammalian natural host defense peptides (mNHP) are short, usually cationic, peptides that have direct antimicrobial activity, and which in some instances activate cell-mediated antiviral immune responses. Although mNHP have potent activity in vitro, efficacy trials in vivo of exogenously provided mNHP have been largely disappointing, and no mNHP are currently licensed for human use. Mastoparan is an invertebrate host defense peptide that penetrates lipid bilayers, and we reasoned that a mastoparan analog might interact with the lipid component of virus membranes and thereby reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses. Our objective was to determine whether mastoparan-derived peptide MP7-NH2 could inactivate viruses of multiple types, and whether it could stimulate cell-mediated antiviral activity. We found that MP7-NH2 potently inactivated a range of enveloped viruses. Consistent with our proposed mechanism of action, MP7-NH2 was not efficacious against a non-enveloped virus. Pre-treatment of cells with MP7-NH2 did not reduce the amount of virus recovered after infection, which suggested that the primary mechanism of action in vitro was direct inactivation of virus by MP7-NH2. These results demonstrate for the first time that a mastoparan derivative has broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and suggest that further investigation of the antiviral properties of mastoparan peptides in vivo is warranted.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cardiac surgery, especially when employing cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, is associated with systemic inflammatory responses that significantly affect morbidity and mortality. Intestinal perfusion abnormalities have been implicated in such responses, but the mechanisms linking local injury and systemic inflammation remain unclear. Intestinal mast cells are specialized immune cells that secrete various preformed effectors in response to cellular stress. We hypothesized that mast cells are activated in a microenvironment shaped by intestinal ischemia/reperfusion, and investigated local and systemic consequences. DESIGN: Rat model of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. SETTING: University research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Twelve- to 14-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Rats were anesthetized and cooled to 16°C to 18°C on cardiopulmonary bypass before instituting deep hypothermic circulatory arrest for 45 minutes. Specimens were harvested following rewarming and 2 hours of recovery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Significant intestinal barrier disruption was found, together with macro- and microscopic evidence of ischemia/reperfusion injury in ileum and colon, but not in the lungs or kidneys. Immunofluorescence and toluidine blue staining revealed increased numbers of mast cells and their activation in the gut. In animals pretreated with the mast cell stabilizer, cromolyn sodium, mast cell degranulation was blocked, and intestinal morphology and barrier function were preserved following deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Furthermore, cromolyn sodium treatment was associated with reduced intestinal neutrophil influx and blunted systemic release of proinflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: Our data provide primary evidence that intestinal ischemia/reperfusion is a leading pathophysiologic process in a rat model of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, and that intestinal injury, and local and systemic inflammatory responses are critically dependent on mast cell activation. This identifies intestinal mast cells as central players in deep hypothermic circulatory arrest-associated responses, and opens novel therapeutic possibilities for patients undergoing this procedure.",

It is associated with reflux nephropathy, a renal lesion characterized by the presence of chronic tubulointersitial inflammation and fibrosis. Most patients are diagnosed with reflux nephropathy after one or more febrile urinary tract infections, suggesting a potential role for infection in its development. We have recently shown that the C3H mouse has a 100% incidence of VUR. Here, we evaluate the roles of VUR and uropathogenic Escherichia coli infection in the development of reflux nephropathy in the C3H mouse. We find that VUR in combination with sustained kidney infection is crucial to the development of reflux nephropathy, whereas sterile reflux alone fails to induce reflux nephropathy. A single bout of kidney infection without reflux fails to induce reflux nephropathy. The host immune response to infection was examined in two refluxing C3H substrains, HeN and HeJ. HeJ mice, which have a defect in innate immunity and bacterial clearance, demonstrate more significant renal inflammation and reflux nephropathy compared with HeN mice. These studies demonstrate the crucial synergy between VUR, sustained kidney infection and the host immune response in the development of reflux nephropathy in a mouse model of VUR.",

In this review we discuss the evidence supporting the dual role of MCs, both as sentinels for invading pathogens and as regulatory cells throughout the course of acute inflammation, from its initiation to resolution. This versatility is dependent on the ability of MCs to detect pathogens and danger signals and release a unique panel of mediators to promote pathogen-specific clearance mechanisms, such as through cellular recruitment or vascular permeability. It is increasingly understood that MCs also contribute to the regulated contraction of immune activation that occurs within tissues as inflammation resolves. This overarching regulatory control over innate immune processes has made MCs successful targets to purposefully enhance or, alternatively, suppress MC responses in multiple therapeutic contexts.",

Although CT is an effective adjuvant, its toxicity will likely prevent its use in nasal vaccines. This study compared non-toxin adjuvants to CT for their ability to induce protective antibody responses with nasal immunization. C3H/HeN and C57BL/6 mice were immunized with rPA formulated with the following adjuvants: CT, IL-1α, LPS, CpG, Pam3CSK4, 3M-019, resiquimod/R848 or c48/80. Serum and nasal wash cytokine concentrations were monitored 6h post-vaccination as biomarkers for acute activation of the innate immune system. Not all of the adjuvants induced significant changes in innate serum or nasal wash cytokines, but when changes were observed, the cytokine signatures were unique for each adjuvant. All adjuvants except Pam3CSK4 induced significantly increased anti-rPA serum IgG titers in both strains of mice, while only IL-1α, c48/80 and CpG enhanced mucosal anti-rPA IgA. Pam3CSK4 was the only adjuvant unable to enhance the induction of serum LeTx-neutralizing antibodies in C3H/HeN mice while c48/80 was the only adjuvant to induce increased serum LeTx-neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice. Only CT enhanced total serum IgE in C3H/HeN mice while IL-1α enhanced total serum IgE in C57BL/6 mice. The adjuvant influenced antigen-specific serum IgG subclass and T cell cytokine profiles, but these responses did not correlate with the induction of LeTx-neutralizing activity. Our results demonstrate the induction of diverse innate and adaptive immune responses by non-toxin nasal vaccine adjuvants that lead to protective humoral immunity comparable to CT and that these responses may be influenced by the host strain.",

The observation that the bladder can become chronically infected in combination with clinical observations that antibody responses after bladder infections are not detectable suggest defects in the formation of adaptive immunity and immunological memory. We have identified a broadly immunosuppressive transcriptional program specific to the bladder, but not the kidney, during infection of the urinary tract that is dependent on tissue-resident mast cells (MCs). This involves localized production of interleukin-10 and results in suppressed humoral and cell-mediated responses and bacterial persistence. Therefore, in addition to the previously described role of MCs orchestrating the early innate immunity during bladder infection, they subsequently play a tissue-specific immunosuppressive role. These findings may explain the prevalent recurrence of bladder infections and suggest the bladder as a site exhibiting an intrinsic degree of MC-maintained immune privilege.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) frequently colonizes the airways of patients with chronic asthma and likely contributes to asthma exacerbations. We previously reported that mice lacking surfactant protein A (SP-A) have increased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) during M pneumoniae infection versus wild-type mice mediated by TNF-α. Mast cells (MCs) have been implicated in AHR in asthma models and produce and respond to TNF-α. OBJECTIVE: Determine the contribution of MC/TNF interactions to AHR in airways lacking functional SP-A during Mp infection. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected from healthy and asthmatic subjects to examine TNF-α levels and M pneumoniae positivity. To determine how SP-A interactions with MCs regulate airway homeostasis, we generated mice lacking both SP-A and MCs (SP-A(-/-)Kit(W-sh/W-sh)) and infected them with M pneumoniae. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that high TNF-α levels correlate with M pneumoniae positivity in human asthmatic patients and that human SP-A inhibits M pneumoniae-stimulated transcription and release of TNF-α by MCs, implicating a protective role for SP-A. MC numbers increase in M pneumoniae-infected lungs, and airway reactivity is dramatically attenuated when MCs are absent. Using SP-A(-/-)Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice engrafted with TNF-α(-/-) or TNF receptor (TNF-R)(-/-) MCs, we found that TNF-α activation of MCs through the TNF-R, but not MC-derived TNF-α, leads to augmented AHR during M pneumoniae infection when SP-A is absent. Additionally, M pneumoniae-infected SP-A(-/-)Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice engrafted with TNF-α(-/-) or TNF-R(-/-) MCs have decreased mucus production compared with that seen in mice engrafted with wild-type MCs, whereas burden was unaffected. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight a previously unappreciated but vital role for MCs as secondary responders to TNF-α during the host response to pathogen infection.",

                  "abstract": "Candida glabrata is an emerging human fungal pathogen that is frequently drug tolerant, resulting in difficulties in treatment and a higher mortality in immunocompromised patients. The calcium-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin plays critical roles in controlling drug tolerance, hyphal growth, and virulence in diverse fungal pathogens via distinct mechanisms involving survival in serum or growth at host temperature (37° and higher). Here, we comprehensively studied the calcineurin signaling cascade in C. glabrata and found novel and uncharacterized functions of calcineurin and its downstream target Crz1 in governing thermotolerance, intracellular architecture, and pathogenesis in murine ocular, urinary tract, and systemic infections. This represents a second independent origin of a role for calcineurin in thermotolerant growth of a major human fungal pathogen, distinct from that which arose independently in Cryptococcus neoformans. Calcineurin also promotes survival of C. glabrata in serum via mechanisms distinct from C. albicans and thereby enables establishment of tissue colonization in a murine systemic infection model. To understand calcineurin signaling in detail, we performed global transcript profiling analysis and identified calcineurin- and Crz1-dependent genes in C. glabrata involved in cell wall biosynthesis, heat shock responses, and calcineurin function. Regulators of calcineurin (RCN) are a novel family of calcineurin modifiers, and two members of this family were identified in C. glabrata: Rcn1 and Rcn2. Our studies demonstrate that Rcn2 expression is controlled by calcineurin and Crz1 to function as a feedback inhibitor of calcineurin in a circuit required for calcium tolerance in C. glabrata. In contrast, the calcineurin regulator Rcn1 activates calcineurin signaling. Interestingly, neither Rcn1 nor Rcn2 is required for virulence in a murine systemic infection model. Taken together, our findings show that calcineurin signaling plays critical roles in thermotolerance and virulence, and that Rcn1 and Rcn2 have opposing functions in controlling calcineurin signaling in C. glabrata.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caveolin-1, the hallmark protein of caveolae, is highly expressed within the lung in the epithelium, endothelium, and in immune cells. In addition to its classical roles in cholesterol metabolism and endocytosis, caveolin-1 has also been shown to be important in inflammatory signaling pathways. In particular, caveolin-1 is known to associate with the nitric oxide synthase enzymes, downregulating their activity. Endotoxins, which are are composed mainly of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), are found ubiquitously in the environment and can lead to the development of airway inflammation and increased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). METHODS: We compared the acute responses of wild-type and caveolin-1 deficient mice after LPS aerosol, a well-accepted mode of endotoxin exposure, to investigate the role of caveolin-1 in the development of environmental lung injury. RESULTS: Although the caveolin-1 deficient mice had greater lung inflammatory indices compared to wild-type mice, they exhibited reduced AHR following LPS exposure. The uncoupling of inflammation and AHR led us to investigate the role of caveolin-1 in the production of nitric oxide, which is known to act as a bronchodilator. The absence of caveolin-1 resulted in increased nitrite levels in the lavage fluid in both sham and LPS treated mice. Additionally, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression was increased in the lung tissue of caveolin-1 deficient mice following LPS exposure and administration of the potent and specific inhibitor 1400W increased AHR to levels comparable to wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: We attribute the relative airway hyporesponsiveness in the caveolin-1 deficient mice after LPS exposure to the specific role of caveolin-1 in mediating nitric oxide production.",

The vaccine formulation was prepared in a powder form by spray-freeze-drying (SFD) under optimized conditions to produce particles with a target size of D(50) = 25 μm, suitable for delivery to the rabbit nasal cavity. Physicochemical properties of the powder vaccines were characterized to assess their delivery and storage potential.

Animal study was performed using a unit-dose powder device for direct nasal application. Results showed that C48/80 provided effective mucosal adjuvant activity in rabbits. Freshly prepared SFD powder vaccine formulations or powders stored for over 2 years at room temperature elicited significantly elevated serum PA-specific and lethal toxin neutralization antibody titers that were comparable to that induced by intramuscular immunization with rPA.

Their involvement in immediate as well as chronic inflammatory reactions at both local and distal sites points to an extraordinarily powerful immunoregulatory capacity with spatial and temporal versatility. MCs are preferentially found in close proximity to both vascular and lymphatic vessels. On activation, they undergo a biphasic secretory response involving the rapid release of prestored vasoactive mediators followed by de novo synthesized products. Many actions of MCs are related to their capacity to regulate vascular flow and permeability and to the recruitment of various inflammatory cells from the vasculature into inflammatory sites. These mediators often work in an additive fashion and achieve their inflammatory effects locally by directly acting on the vascular and lymphatic endothelia, but they also can affect distal sites. Along these lines, the lymphatic and endothelial vasculatures of the host act as a conduit for the dissemination of MC signals during inflammation. The central role of the MC-endothelial cell axis to immune homeostasis is emphasized by the fact that some of the most effective current treatments for inflammatory disorders are directed at interfering with this interaction.",

However, the specific candidate genes within this region accounting for emphysema-like changes remain unrecognized. c-Kit is a receptor tyrosine kinase within this candidate gene region that has previously been recognized to contribute to the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Increases in the percentage of cells expressing c-Kit have previously been associated with protection against injury-induced emphysema. OBJECTIVES: Determine whether genetic variants of c-Kit are associated with spontaneous airspace enlargement. METHODS: Perform single-nucleotide polymorphism association studies in the mouse strains at the extremes of airspace enlargement phenotype for variants in c-Kit tyrosine kinase. Characterize mice bearing functional variants of c-Kit compared with wild-type controls for the development of spontaneous airspace enlargement. Epithelial cell proliferation was measured in culture. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Upstream regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the divergent mouse strains were associated with the lung compliance difference observed between the extreme strains. c-Kit mutant mice (Kit(W-sh)/(W-sh)), when compared with genetic controls, developed altered lung histology, increased total lung capacity, increased residual volume, and increased lung compliance that persist into adulthood. c-Kit inhibition with imatinib attenuated in vitro proliferation of cells expressing epithelial cell adhesion molecule. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that c-Kit sustains and/or maintains normal alveolar architecture in the lungs of mice. In vitro data suggest that c-Kit can regulate epithelial cell clonal expansion. The precise mechanisms that c-Kit contributes to the development of airspace enlargement and increased lung compliance remain unclear and warrants further investigation.",

This multifaceted response of MCs to DENV is consequential to the containment of DENV in vivo because, after s.c. infection, MC-deficient mice show increased viral burden within draining lymph nodes, which are known to be targeted organs during DENV spread, compared with MC-sufficient mice. This containment of DENV is linked to the MC-driven recruitment of natural killer and natural killer T cells into the infected skin. These findings support expanding the defined role of immunosurveillance by MCs to include viral pathogens.",

                  "abstract": "Allergic asthma is characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation, and a cellular infiltrate dominated by eosinophils. Numerous epidemiological studies have related the exacerbation of allergic asthma with an increase in ambient inhalable particulate matter from air pollutants. This is because inhalable particles efficiently deliver airborne allergens deep into the airways, where they can aggravate allergic asthma symptoms. However, the cellular mechanisms by which inhalable particulate allergens (pAgs) potentiate asthmatic symptoms remain unknown, in part because most in vivo and in vitro studies exploring the pathogenesis of allergic asthma use soluble allergens (sAgs). Using a mouse model of allergic asthma, we found that, compared with their sAg counterparts, pAgs triggered markedly heightened airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary eosinophilia in allergen-sensitized mice. Mast cells (MCs) were implicated in this divergent response, as the differences in airway inflammatory responses provoked by the physical nature of the allergens were attenuated in MC-deficient mice. The pAgs were found to mediate MC-dependent responses by enhancing retention of pAg/IgE/FcεRI complexes within lipid raft–enriched, CD63(+) endocytic compartments, which prolonged IgE/FcεRI-initiated signaling and resulted in heightened cytokine responses. These results reveal how the physical attributes of allergens can co-opt MC endocytic circuitry and signaling responses to aggravate pathological responses of allergic asthma in mice.",

This study was performed to determine if Ad2F would enhance the nasal immunogenicity of Hcβtre in rabbits, an animal model with a nasal cavity anatomy similar to humans. Since CT is not safe for human use, we also tested the adjuvant activity of compound 48/80 (C48/80), a mast cell activating compound previously determined to safely exhibit nasal adjuvant activity in mice. METHODS: New Zealand White or Dutch Belted rabbits were nasally immunized with Hcβtre or Hcβtre-Ad2F alone or combined with CT or C48/80, and serum samples were tested for the presence of Hcβtre-specific binding (ELISA) or BoNT/A neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: Hcβtre-Ad2F nasally administered with CT induced serum anti-Hcβtre IgG ELISA and BoNT/A neutralizing antibody titers greater than those induced by Hcβtre + CT. C48/80 provided significant nasal adjuvant activity and induced BoNT/A-neutralizing antibodies similar to those induced by CT. CONCLUSIONS: Ad2F enhanced the nasal immunogenicity of Hcβtre, and the mast cell activator C48/80 was an effective adjuvant for nasal immunization in rabbits, an animal model with a nasal cavity anatomy similar to that in humans.",

However, developments over the last 15 years have suggested that MCs have evolved in vertebrates as beneficial effector cells that are involved in the very first inflammatory responses generated during infection. This pro-inflammatory environment has been demonstrated to be important for initiating innate responses in many different models of infection and more recently, in the development of adaptive immunity as well. Interestingly this latter finding has led to the discovery that small MC-activating compounds can behave as adjuvants in vaccine formulations. Thus, our continued understanding of the MC in the context of infectious disease is likely to not only expand our scope of the MC in the normal processes of immunity, but provide new therapeutic targets to combat disease.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is hypothesized to result from stimulation of immune responses against resident intestinal bacteria within a genetically susceptible host. Mast cells may play a critical role in IBD pathogenesis, since they are typically located just beneath the intestinal mucosal barrier and can be activated by bacterial antigens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study investigated effects of mast cells on inflammation and associated neoplasia in IBD-susceptible interleukin (IL)-10-deficient mice with and without mast cells. IL-10-deficient mast cells produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro both constitutively and when triggered, compared with wild type mast cells. However despite this enhanced in vitro response, mast cell-sufficient Il10(-/-) mice actually had decreased cecal expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN)-gamma mRNA, suggesting that mast cells regulate inflammation in vivo. Mast cell deficiency predisposed Il10(-/-) mice to the development of spontaneous colitis and resulted in increased intestinal permeability in vivo that preceded the development of colon inflammation. However, mast cell deficiency did not affect the severity of IBD triggered by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) exposure or helicobacter infection that also affect intestinal permeability. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Mast cells thus appear to have a primarily protective role within the colonic microenvironment by enhancing the efficacy of the mucosal barrier. In addition, although mast cells were previously implicated in progression of sporadic colon cancers, mast cells did not affect the incidence or severity of colonic neoplasia in this inflammation-associated model.",

However, there is a growing appreciation that an important physiological function of these cells is the recognition of pathogens and modulation of appropriate immune responses. Because of their ability to instantly release several pro-inflammatory mediators from intracellular stores and their location at the host-environment interface, mast cells have been shown to be crucial for optimal immune responses during infection. Mast cells seem to exert these effects by altering the inflammatory environment after detection of a pathogen and by mobilizing various immune cells to the site of infection and to draining lymph nodes. Interestingly, the character and timing of these responses can vary depending on the type of pathogen stimulus, location of pathogen recognition and sensitization state of the responding mast cells. Recent studies using mast cell activators as effective vaccine adjuvants show the potential of harnessing these cells to confer protective immunity against microbial pathogens.",

This paper aims to explore alternative to discipline programs for nurses to determine whether these programs are relevant to other geographical contexts. A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology. The PRIMSA-ScR checklist was used in this scoping review. The databases searched included MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Elsevier), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EBSCOhost), and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global (ProQuest) from 1984 to 2024. Title and abstract screening was conducted on 1622 papers, resulting in 90 papers for full-text screening. After full-text screening, 19 papers met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Issues related to the cost of programs, strict requirements for abstinence, and a lack of 'bespoke' options that address participant needs were identified in this review and need to be addressed prior to global implementation of these programs. Impairment of nurses due to alcohol and/or drug use threatens workforce sustainability, and without 'alternatives to discipline', can mean experience nurses are lost to the profession, often without treatment. Exploration of alterative to discipline programs is essential to ensure that nurses with alcohol and other drug challenges are retained in the profession and receive the treatment required to remain safe practitioners. Likewise, the perception that programs were punitive in nature should be addressed to ensure acceptability of these programs as an alternative to the loss of employment.",

                  "abstract": "In addiction treatment, harm reduction is a philosophy that aims to reduce the harms from ongoing alcohol and other drug use. Although abstinence may be the 'gold standard' in reducing harm from ongoing alcohol and other drug use, harm reduction recognises that abstinence may not be achievable for certain individuals. Accordingly, harm reduction is used to enable medical or mental health treatment for individuals who continue to use alcohol and other drugs, providing a form of care which meets individuals where they present to healthcare facilities. Harm reduction accepts ongoing alcohol and other drug use, while providing a traditionally marginalised cohort of individuals access to healthcare services. In this perspective paper, we argue that the role of nurses in promoting and utilising harm reduction as part of their regular practice is essential to both reducing harm from alcohol and other drug use, engaging individuals who use alcohol and other drugs in healthcare services, and providing a means to accept individuals as they are to build trust and rapport for engagement in addiction treatment when they are ready, and at their own pace. Nurses, by virtue of their role and number in the healthcare landscape (approximately 28 million globally), are ideally placed to implement harm reduction in their practice to achieve better outcomes for individuals who use alcohol and other drugs.",

A handsearch and a grey literature search was conducted.<h4>Results</h4>Title and abstract screening was performed on 774 articles resulting in 88 articles for full text screening. Full text screening yielded 13 articles that met inclusion criteria.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Existing nurse-led models of care for SUDS are scarce and limited in scope, with the majority focused on treating opioid use disorder. Additional research is needed to develop, test, and implement efficacious nurse-led models of care for the treatment and management of SUDs.<h4>Implications to clinical practice</h4>Nurse led models of care have demonstrated their efficacy and quality in the management of other chronic diseases. As we move forward with innovative solutions for individuals with addiction, nurse led models of care can be a mechanism to deliver high quality, evidence-based care for SUDs.<h4>Impact</h4>SUDs are chronic diseases that impact individuals, families, and communities. SUDs require a biopsychosocial approach to treatment. Globally, nurses are well positioned to provide high quality care to mitigate the impact of SUDs.

The aim of this study was to explore perceived stigma towards the addiction nursing speciality, addiction nursing (also known as alcohol and other drug nursing) and its impact on workforce sustainability, retention and recruitment. Secondary analysis of qualitative interview data with nurses (n = 50) and survey data (n = 337) was conducted as part of a workforce mapping exercise in 2019. COREQ reporting guidelines were used. After structural coding was applied, three themes emerged: stigma experienced by clients of alcohol and other drug treatment services, stigma experienced by addiction nurses and a lack of awareness of the specialty of addiction nursing itself. Participants overwhelmingly felt that these forms of stigma made addiction nursing less attractive to new entrants, particularly new nurses and posed a threat to the sustainability of the specialty. The findings from this study indicate that urgent attention is required to address stigma towards individuals who use alcohol and other drugs, and the nurses providing care for them. Furthermore, creating awareness of the addiction nursing specialty is paramount to ensure workforce sustainability and to improve care for individuals who use alcohol and other drugs. Beyond addiction nurses, our results indicate that stigma towards other specialties (such as mental health nursing) is a substantive barrier to workforce sustainability.",

                  "abstract": "Background: Electronic health systems contain large amounts of unstructured data (UD) which are often unanalyzed due to the time and costs involved. Unanalyzed data creates missed opportunities to improve health outcomes. Natural language processing (NLP) is the foundation of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), which is the basis for large language models, such as ChatGPT. NLP and GAI are machine learning methods that analyze large amounts of data in a short time at minimal cost. The ability of NLP to conduct qualitative analyses is increasing, yet the results can lack context and nuance in their findings, requiring human intervention. Methods: Our study compared outcomes, time, and costs of a previously published qualitative study. Our approach partnered an NLP model and a qualitative researcher (NLP+). UD from behavioral health patients were analyzed using NLP and a Latent Dirichlet allocation to identify the topics using probability of word coherence scores. The topics were then analyzed by a qualitative researcher, translated into themes, and compared with the original findings. Results: The NLP + method results aligned with the original, qualitative derived themes. Our model also identified two additional themes which were not originally detected. The NLP + method required 6 hours of labor, 3 minutes for transcription, and a transcription cost of $1.17. The original, qualitative researcher only method required more than 36 hours ($2,250) of time and $1,100 for transcription. Conclusions: While natural language processing analyzes voluminous amounts of data in seconds, context and nuance in human language are regularly missed. Combining a qualitative researcher with NLP + could be deployed in many settings, reducing time and costs, and improving context. Until large language models are more prevalent, a human interaction can help translate the patient experience by contextualizing data rich in social determinant indicators which may otherwise go unanalyzed.",

Many national datasets restrict data to reduce the probability of identifying persons. Alaska is a small population state (731,000 residents) with a large geographic region (25% the size of the lower 48), a diverse population, and highly variable seasons, with fewer than 10% of the state being road accessible. Given the uniqueness of Alaska, this project sought to understand what could be learned about addiction and its relationships with unemployment and median income in Alaska. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, State and Small Area Estimates (1999-2020) data were analyzed to measure prevalence changes. Outcome prevalence were independently correlated with median income and annual unemployment rate as the annual collection periods varied. Analyses were limited to simple bivariate analyses due to the data restrictions. Median income was found to have stronger correlational relationships and significant relationships with more negative outcomes compared to unemployment. While annual unemployment rates had statistically significant relationships with substance use outcomes, negative mental health outcomes appeared more related to unemployment than median income. Alcohol use in the past month, cigarette and tobacco use, and pain reliever misuse declined while binge drinking in the past month and illicit drug use increased. More people reported depression, serious mental illness, and suicidal ideation and planning over time peaking in the last year of data collection. While NSDUH data provide some idea of the changes in drug use over time, their effectiveness in Alaska is unknown. Many data sources claim they are nationally representative, but these statements cannot be objectively measured. We will use these outcomes and data as a baseline for future studies where we will explore state specific data sources.",

These methods are time and cost intensive, often resulting in small sample sizes and yielding findings that are complicated to replicate. Integrating natural language processing (NLP) into a qualitative project can increase efficiency through time and cost savings; increase sample sizes; and allow for validation through replication. This study compared the findings, costs, and time spent between a traditional qualitative method (Investigator only) to a method pairing a qualitative investigator with an NLP function (Investigator +NLP). Methods: Using secondary data from a previously published study, the investigators designed an NLP process in Python to yield a corpus, keywords, keyword influence, and the primary topics. A qualitative researcher reviewed and interpreted the output. These findings were compared to the previous study results. Results: Using comparative review, our results closely matched the original findings. The NLP + Investigator method reduced the project time by a minimum of 120 hours and costs by $1,500. Discussion: Qualitative research can evolve by incorporating NLP methods. These methods can increase sample size, reduce project time, and significantly reduce costs. The results of an integrated NLP process create a corpus and code which can be reviewed and verified, thus allowing a replicable, qualitative study. New data can be added over time and analyzed using the same interpretation and identification. Off the shelf qualitative software may be easier to use, but it can be expensive and may not offer a tailored approach or easily interpretable outcomes which further benefits researchers.",

The nine study participants, two males and seven females, aged 27-60 had worked in SUD treatment for 1-37 years. Three major themes, with sub-themes, emerged: Defining the Role for Self; Learning the Role; and Navigating with Ease in an Unchangeable Culture. Findings demonstrated that nurses in SUD treatment value their role and the care of patients with SUDs. Patient recovery or relapse influenced job satisfaction. Significantly, the findings highlighted an outdated role with rigid boundaries and no real contemporary identity. Findings can be used to address the need for a contemporary SUD nursing identity and to support ongoing involvement of nurses in health policy related to SUDs.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) account for a heavy burden of illness in low- and middle-income country settings, but the etiology of these infections is often unknown. In this study, we applied the BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® Pneumonia plus Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay with bacterial, viral, and antibacterial resistance gene targets, on sputum samples to evaluate the etiology of community-acquired LRTI among hospitalized patients in southern Sri Lanka. METHODS: We enrolled children and adults hospitalized with LRTIs at a public tertiary care hospital in southern Sri Lanka from 2019 to 2021. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and a sputum sample for each patient was tested using the Pneumonia plus Panel. Assay results were compared with sputum culture results. Fisher's exact test was applied to identify association between the presence of viruses, bacteria, or antimicrobial resistant genes and the findings of the chest radiographs during hospitalization as well as associations between the genomic concentration identified through the panel and the bacteria known to cause typical pneumonia infection included in the panel. RESULTS: In 267 patients tested, the most detected bacteria by the Pneumonia plus Panel were the Klebsiella pneumoniae group (41.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (34.5%), and the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (32.6%). The most detected viruses were the human rhinovirus/enterovirus (19.5%) and influenza A (10.9%). In total, 211 patients (79.0%) had at least one gram-negative bacterium and 139 patients (52.1%) had at least one gram-positive bacteria. As for Antimicrobial Resistance, 96 patients (40.0%) had at least one carbapenem resistant gene, 56 patients (21.0%) had an extended spectrum beta-lactamase related gene, and 42 patients (15.7%) had a methicillin resistant gene. Only 15 patients (5.6%) were identified to have Pneumonia plus Panel results matching with sputum culture results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with LRTI in Southern Province, Sri Lanka have a high prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and antibacterial resistance in their sputum samples. However, it remains difficult to differentiate isolates that are colonizers not leading to disease versus the true cause of infection via the use of the BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® Pneumonia plus Panel on sputum samples.",

The utility of EBV surveillance in adult EBV seropositive LTRs is unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of EBV seropositive adult LTRs who underwent lung transplant between 1/1/19 and 12/31/20 and received whole blood (WB) EBV PCR surveillance. We compared peak WB EBV VLs among 3 groups: 1) asymptomatic LTRs who developed PTLD, before PTLD was clinically suspected, 2) LTRs who developed PTLD, after PTLD was clinically suspected, and 3) LTRs who did not develop PTLD. We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) of moderate-grade DNAemia (2840 to 11,360 IU/mL) and high-grade DNAemia (≥ 11,360 IU/mL) for identifying active or future PTLD. RESULTS: Six (2.6 %) of 229 LTRs developed PTLD. Among LTRs who developed PTLD, median peak EBV VL was significantly higher after PTLD was suspected than before clinical signs of PTLD were present (16,004 IU/mL vs. ≤568 IU/mL, p = 0.016). Median peak EBV VLs were similar between asymptomatic LTRs who later developed PTLD and LTRs who did not develop PTLD (median peak EBV VL ≤568 IU/mL vs. ≤568 IU/mL, p = 0.62). The PPVs for moderate- and high-grade DNAemia were 14.7 % and 33.3 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: EBV surveillance did not accurately identify EBV seropositive LTRs at risk for progressing to PTLD. EBV PCR testing in asymptomatic EBV seropositive transplant recipients may represent an opportunity for diagnostic stewardship.",

Evidence to support implementation of telemedicine during postoperative recovery will be an essential component of pandemic recovery.<h4>Methods</h4>The primary outcome of this study was SSI reported up to 30 days after surgery (SSI), comparing rates reported using telemedicine (telephone and/or video assessment) to those with in-person review. The first part of this study analyzed primary data from an international cohort study of adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery who were discharged from hospital before 30 days after surgery. The second part combined this data with the results of a systematic review to perform a meta-analysis of all available data conducted in accordance with PRIMSA guidelines (PROSPERO:192596).<h4>Results</h4>The cohort study included 15,358 patients from 66 countries (8069 high, 4448 middle, 1744 low income). Of these, 6907 (45.0%) were followed up using telemedicine. The SSI rate reported using telemedicine was slightly lower than with in-person follow-up (13.4% vs 11.1%, P <0.001), which persisted after risk adjustment in a mixed-effects model (adjusted odds ratio: 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.84, P <0.001). This association was consistent across sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including a propensity-score matched model. In 9 eligible nonrandomized studies identified, a pooled mean of 64% of patients underwent telemedicine follow-up. Upon meta-analysis, the SSI rate reported was lower with telemedicine (odds ratio: 0.67, 0.47-0.94) than in-person (reference) follow-up ( I2 =0.45, P =0.12), although there a high risk of bias in included studies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Use of telemedicine to assess the surgical wound postdischarge is feasible, but risks underreporting of SSI. Standardized tools for remote assessment of SSI must be evaluated and adopted as telemedicine is upscaled globally.",

However, it is unclear what constitutes person-centered care in populations affected by conflict, as they may have specific concerns in the dimensions of physical, emotional, social, and spiritual wellbeing. This study aimed to identify what matters to patients with advanced cancer and family caregivers in Jordan including refugees, to inform appropriate person-centered assessment and palliative care in conflict-affected populations.<h4>Methods</h4>Cross-sectional face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted at two sites in Amman. Adult patients with advanced cancer and family caregivers were purposively sampled to maximize diversity and representation. Interviews were digitally audio recorded, anonymized, and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis.<h4>Findings</h4>Four themes were generated from 50 patients (22 refugees; 28 Jordanians) and 20 caregivers (7 refugees; 13 Jordanians) (1). Information, communication, and decision-making. Truth-telling and full disclosure from clinicians was valued, and participants expressed concerns that information was not shared in case patients would disengage with treatment. (2) Priorities and concerns for care and support. Participants' top priority remained cure and recovery (which was viewed as possible). Other priorities included returning to their \"normal\" life and their \"own\" country, and to continue contributing to their family. (3) Role of spirituality and Islam. Most participants had strong faith in God and felt that having faith could comfort them. For refugees whose social network was fractured due to being away from home country, prayer and Quran reading became particularly important. (4) Unmet support needs of family caregivers. Family caregivers were affected physically and emotionally by worrying about and caring for the patients. They needed support and training, but often could not access this.<h4>Discussion</h4>Truth-telling is highly valued and essential to achieving person-centered care and informed decision-making. This study also reveals specific concerns in conflict-affected populations, reflecting the experience of prior losses and fracturing of existing social networks and support. The role of religion is crucial in supporting refugee communities, and consideration should be paid to the needs of patients and caregivers when caring for a patient at home without access to their communities of origin and the support they accessed.",

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Multicenter, international COVID-19 registry. SUBJECTS: Adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients on antihypertensive agents (AHAs) prior to admission, admitted from March 31, 2020, to March 10, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were compared between three groups: patients on RAASIs only, other AHAs only, and those on both medications. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions were performed after controlling for prehospitalization characteristics to estimate the effect of RAASIs on mortality and other outcomes during hospitalization. Of 26,652 patients, 7,975 patients were on AHAs prior to hospitalization. Of these, 1,542 patients (19.3%) were on RAASIs only, 3,765 patients (47.2%) were on other AHAs only, and 2,668 (33.5%) patients were on both medications. Compared with those taking other AHAs only, patients on RAASIs only were younger (mean age 63.3 vs 66.9 yr; p < 0.0001), more often male (58.2% vs 52.4%; p = 0.0001) and more often White (55.1% vs 47.2%; p < 0.0001). After adjusting for age, gender, race, location, and comorbidities, patients on combination of RAASIs and other AHAs had higher in-hospital mortality than those on RAASIs only (odds ratio [OR] = 1.28; 95% CI [1.19-1.38]; p < 0.0001) and higher mortality than those on other AHAs only (OR = 1.09; 95% CI [1.03-1.15]; p = 0.0017). Patients on RAASIs only had lower mortality than those on other AHAs only (OR = 0.87; 95% CI [0.81-0.94]; p = 0.0003). Patients on ACEIs only had higher mortality compared with those on ARBs only (OR = 1.37; 95% CI [1.20-1.56]; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 who were taking AHAs, prior use of a combination of RAASIs and other AHAs was associated with higher in-hospital mortality than the use of RAASIs alone.

                  "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>There is a substantial gap in provision of adequate surgical care in many low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to identify the economic burden of unmet surgical need for the common condition of appendicitis.<h4>Methods</h4>Data on the incidence of appendicitis from 170 countries and two different approaches were used to estimate numbers of patients who do not receive surgery: as a fixed proportion of the total unmet surgical need per country (approach 1); and based on country income status (approach 2). Indirect costs with current levels of access and local quality, and those if quality were at the standards of high-income countries, were estimated. A human capital approach was applied, focusing on the economic burden resulting from premature death and absenteeism.<h4>Results</h4>Excess mortality was 4185 per 100 000 cases of appendicitis using approach 1 and 3448 per 100 000 using approach 2. The economic burden of continuing current levels of access and local quality was US $92 492 million using approach 1 and $73 141 million using approach 2. The economic burden of not providing surgical care to the standards of high-income countries was $95 004 million using approach 1 and $75 666 million using approach 2. The largest share of these costs resulted from premature death (97.7 per cent) and lack of access (97.0 per cent) in contrast to lack of quality.<h4>Conclusion</h4>For a comparatively non-complex emergency condition such as appendicitis, increasing access to care should be prioritized. Although improving quality of care should not be neglected, increasing provision of care at current standards could reduce societal costs substantially.",

The aim of this study was to examine the association between hospital infrastructure, resource availability, and processes on early outcomes after cancer surgery worldwide.<h4>Methods</h4>A multimethods analysis was performed as part of the GlobalSurg 3 study-a multicentre, international, prospective cohort study of patients who had surgery for breast, colorectal, or gastric cancer. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and 30-day major complication rates. Potentially beneficial hospital facilities were identified by variable selection to select those associated with 30-day mortality. Adjusted outcomes were determined using generalised estimating equations to account for patient characteristics and country-income group, with population stratification by hospital.<h4>Findings</h4>Between April 1, 2018, and April 23, 2019, facility-level data were collected for 9685 patients across 238 hospitals in 66 countries (91 hospitals in 20 high-income countries; 57 hospitals in 19 upper-middle-income countries; and 90 hospitals in 27 low-income to lower-middle-income countries). The availability of five hospital facilities was inversely associated with mortality: ultrasound, CT scanner, critical care unit, opioid analgesia, and oncologist. After adjustment for case-mix and country income group, hospitals with three or fewer of these facilities (62 hospitals, 1294 patients) had higher mortality compared with those with four or five (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3·85 [95% CI 2·58-5·75]; p<0·0001), with excess mortality predominantly explained by a limited capacity to rescue following the development of major complications (63·0% vs 82·7%; OR 0·35 [0·23-0·53]; p<0·0001). Across LMICs, improvements in hospital facilities would prevent one to three deaths for every 100 patients undergoing surgery for cancer.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Hospitals with higher levels of infrastructure and resources have better outcomes after cancer surgery, independent of country income. Without urgent strengthening of hospital infrastructure and resources, the reductions in cancer-associated mortality associated with improved access will not be realised.<h4>Funding</h4>National Institute for Health and Care Research.",

However, PCC evolved in a few high-income countries and there are limited data exploring this concept across the vast majority of countries which are low- and middle-income. This study aimed to appraise and adapt a PCC model across three serious physical conditions in three middle-income countries and generate an evidence-based framework and recommendations for globally relevant PCC.<h4>Methods</h4>Cross-national, cross-sectional qualitative study. In depth, semistructured interviews conducted with: advanced cancer patients in Jordan (n=50), their caregivers (n=20) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) (n=20); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in South Africa (n=22), their caregivers (n=19) and HCPs (n=22); heart failure patients in Thailand (n=14), their caregivers (n=10) and HCPs (n=12). Data were analysed using framework analysis. Santana <i>et al</i>'s PCC model (2018) and Giusti <i>et al</i>'s systematic review (2020) were used to construct an a priori coding frame for deductive analysis, with additional inductive coding for coding that did not fit the frame.<h4>Results</h4>The findings both reveal specific practical actions that contribute towards delivering PCC and highlight new cross-national domains of person-centredness: interdependency and collectivism; bringing care into the home and community; equity and non-discrimination; addressing health and illness within the context of limited resources; and workforce well-being.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The data suggest that PCC requires particular structural features of the healthcare system to be in place, such as professional education in PCC values and partnerships with community-based workers. These structures may better enable PCC processes, including tailored information sharing and providing genuine opportunities for patients to do the things that matter to them, such as making informed care decisions and sustaining social relationships. PCC must also accommodate a collectivist perspective and support the well-being of the workforce.",

Our objectives were to evaluate the epidemiology of SARS-CoV2-related AKI across the age spectrum and determine if known risk factors such as illness severity contribute to its pattern.<h4>Methods</h4>Secondary analysis of ongoing prospective international cohort registry. AKI was defined by KDIGO-creatinine only criteria. Log-linear, logistic and generalized estimating equations assessed odds ratios (OR), risk differences (RD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for AKI and mortality adjusting for sex, pre-existing comorbidities, race/ethnicity, illness severity, and clustering within centers. Sensitivity analyses assessed different baseline creatinine estimators.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, among 6874 hospitalized patients, 39.6% (n = 2719) developed AKI. There was a bimodal distribution of AKI by age with peaks in older age (≥60 years) and middle childhood (5-15 years), which persisted despite controlling for illness severity, pre-existing comorbidities, or different baseline creatinine estimators. For example, the adjusted OR of developing AKI among hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 was 2.74 (95% CI 1.66-4.56) for 10-15-year-olds compared to 30-35-year-olds and similarly was 2.31 (95% CI 1.71-3.12) for 70-75-year-olds, while adjusted OR dropped to 1.39 (95% CI 0.97-2.00) for 40-45-year-olds compared to 30-35-year-olds.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SARS-CoV2-related AKI is common with a bimodal age distribution that is not fully explained by known risk factors or confounders. As the pandemic turns to disproportionately impacting younger individuals, this deserves further investigation as the presence of AKI and SARS-CoV2 infection increases hospital mortality risk.",

The aim of our study is to confirm the value of the CNS-IPI in predicting CNS relapse in our young study population and to evaluate its impact on the selection of patients for CNS prophylaxis. Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with DLBCL who were treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (RCHOP) regimen from January 2010 till December 2018. Correlation between CNS-IPI and cumulative incidence of CNS relapse and time to CNS relapse was examined through Kaplan-Meier plots. Median time to CNS relapse and median overall survival after CNS relapse were also estimated using the Kaplan-Meier plots.  Results A total of 354 patients were included. The median age was 46 years. Overall, 5% of the patients developed CNS relapse. Median survival after CNS relapse was seven months. Two-year CNS relapse rates according to CNS-IPI were 0.7%, 5.1%, and 26% for low, intermediate, and high-risk, groups respectively. On multivariate analysis, poor performance status (p=0.045), involvement of two or more extranodal sites (p= 0.021), involvement of bone marrow (p= 0.029), and renal or adrenal glands (p= 0.006) significantly correlated with CNS relapse. Considering the CNS-IPI and high-risk anatomical sites (breast, uterus, testis, and epidural space), 26% of our patients with DLBCL would have needed prophylaxis. Conclusion Although CNS-IPI helps in better selection of DLBCL patients for CNS prophylaxis, it can possibly increase the number of patients exposed to unnecessary prophylaxis. More investigational biomarkers are needed to better refining high-risk patients.",

Refugees often experienced unmet psychosocial needs. However, psychosocial support was reported either absent or limited. (2) Knowledge and uncertainty. Lack of information and poor communication between healthcare providers and patients caused significant distress due to uncertainty. (3) Family anxiety and support roles. Being away from the home country cut patients and caregivers off from their wider social support network, which added increased anxiety and responsibilities to caregivers. (4) Compounded trauma and poverty. Many refugees have experienced trauma related to war that may affect their physical and mental health. They faced serious financial crises caused by the rising cost of medicines and treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study reveals the impact of fractured families and networks on social support in advanced cancer, and the compounding trauma of the disease for refugees.

Secondary outcomes were discharge home with or without assistance and hospital length of stay. Risk-adjusted variation in hospital mortality for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation was assessed by using multilevel models with hospitals as a random effect, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, and comorbidities. Among 20,608 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, the mean (± sd) age was 60.5 (±17), 11,1887 (54.3%) were men, 8,745 (42.4%) were admitted to the ICU, and 3,906 (19%) died in the hospital. Hospital mortality was 8.2% for patients receiving no organ support (n = 15,001). The most common organ support therapy was invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 5,005; 24.3%), with a hospital mortality of 49.8%. Mortality ranged from 40.8% among patients receiving only invasive mechanical ventilation (n =1,749) to 71.6% for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and new renal replacement therapy (n = 655). Mortality was 39% for patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 389). Rates of discharge home ranged from 73.5% for patients who did not require organ support therapies to 29.8% for patients who only received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 8.8% for invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and renal replacement; 10.8% of patients older than 74 years who received invasive mechanical ventilation were discharged home. Median hospital length of stay for patients on mechanical ventilation was 17.1 days (9.7-28 d). Adjusted interhospital variation in mortality among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation was large (median odds ratio 1.69).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Coronavirus disease 2019 prognosis varies by age and level of organ support. Interhospital variation in mortality of mechanically ventilated patients was not explained by patient characteristics and requires further evaluation.",

We compared postoperative outcomes in breast, colorectal, and gastric cancer surgery in hospitals worldwide, focusing on the effect of disease stage and complications on postoperative mortality.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a multicentre, international prospective cohort study of consecutive adult patients undergoing surgery for primary breast, colorectal, or gastric cancer requiring a skin incision done under general or neuraxial anaesthesia. The primary outcome was death or major complication within 30 days of surgery. Multilevel logistic regression determined relationships within three-level nested models of patients within hospitals and countries. Hospital-level infrastructure effects were explored with three-way mediation analyses. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03471494.<h4>Findings</h4>Between April 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2019, we enrolled 15 958 patients from 428 hospitals in 82 countries (high income 9106 patients, 31 countries; upper-middle income 2721 patients, 23 countries; or lower-middle income 4131 patients, 28 countries). Patients in LMICs presented with more advanced disease compared with patients in high-income countries. 30-day mortality was higher for gastric cancer in low-income or lower-middle-income countries (adjusted odds ratio 3·72, 95% CI 1·70-8·16) and for colorectal cancer in low-income or lower-middle-income countries (4·59, 2·39-8·80) and upper-middle-income countries (2·06, 1·11-3·83). No difference in 30-day mortality was seen in breast cancer. The proportion of patients who died after a major complication was greatest in low-income or lower-middle-income countries (6·15, 3·26-11·59) and upper-middle-income countries (3·89, 2·08-7·29). Postoperative death after complications was partly explained by patient factors (60%) and partly by hospital or country (40%). The absence of consistently available postoperative care facilities was associated with seven to 10 more deaths per 100 major complications in LMICs. Cancer stage alone explained little of the early variation in mortality or postoperative complications.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Higher levels of mortality after cancer surgery in LMICs was not fully explained by later presentation of disease. The capacity to rescue patients from surgical complications is a tangible opportunity for meaningful intervention. Early death after cancer surgery might be reduced by policies focusing on strengthening perioperative care systems to detect and intervene in common complications.<h4>Funding</h4>National Institute for Health Research Global Health Research Unit.",

                  "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). However, there is a lack of data available about SSI in children worldwide, especially from low-income and middle-income countries. This study aimed to estimate the incidence of SSI in children and associations between SSI and morbidity across human development settings.<h4>Methods</h4>A multicentre, international, prospective, validated cohort study of children aged under 16 years undergoing clean-contaminated, contaminated or dirty gastrointestinal surgery. Any hospital in the world providing paediatric surgery was eligible to contribute data between January and July 2016. The primary outcome was the incidence of SSI by 30 days. Relationships between explanatory variables and SSI were examined using multilevel logistic regression. Countries were stratified into high development, middle development and low development groups using the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI).<h4>Results</h4>Of 1159 children across 181 hospitals in 51 countries, 523 (45·1%) children were from high HDI, 397 (34·2%) from middle HDI and 239 (20·6%) from low HDI countries. The 30-day SSI rate was 6.3% (33/523) in high HDI, 12·8% (51/397) in middle HDI and 24·7% (59/239) in low HDI countries. SSI was associated with higher incidence of 30-day mortality, intervention, organ-space infection and other HAIs, with the highest rates seen in low HDI countries. Median length of stay in patients who had an SSI was longer (7.0 days), compared with 3.0 days in patients who did not have an SSI. Use of laparoscopy was associated with significantly lower SSI rates, even after accounting for HDI.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The odds of SSI in children is nearly four times greater in low HDI compared with high HDI countries. Policies to reduce SSI should be prioritised as part of the wider global agenda.",

                  "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13) assesses quality of life (QOL) in patients with lung cancer and was the first EORTC module developed for use in international clinical trials. Since its publication in 1994, major treatment advances with possible effects on QOL have occurred. These changes called for an update of the module and its international psychometric validation. We aimed to investigate the scale structure and psychometric properties of the updated lung cancer module, QLQ-LC29, in patients with lung cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>This international, observational field study was done in 19 hospitals across 12 countries. Patients aged older than 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer and no other previous primary tumour, and who were mentally fit with sufficient language skills to understand and complete the questionnaire were included. Patients were asked during a hospital visit to fill in the paper versions of the core questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 plus QLQ-LC29, and investigators selected half of these patients to complete the questionnaire again 2-4 weeks later. Our primary aim was to assess the scale structure and psychometric properties of EORTC QLQ-LC29. We analysed scale structure using confirmatory factor analysis; reliability using Cronbach's α value (internal consistency) and intra-class coefficient (test-retest reliability); sensitivity using independent t tests stratified by Karnofsky performance status; and responsiveness to change over time by ANOVA. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02745691.<h4>Findings</h4>Between April 12, 2016, and Sept 26, 2018, 523 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of either non-small-cell lung cancer (n=442) or small-cell lung cancer (n=81) were recruited. Confirmatory factor analysis provided a solution composed of five multi-item scales (coughing, shortness of breath, fear of progression, hair problems, and surgery-related symptoms) plus 15 single symptom or side-effect items: χ<sup>2</sup>=370·233, root mean square error of approximation=0·075, and comparative-fit index=0·901. Cronbach's α for internal consistencies of all multi-item scales were above the threshold of 0·70. Intra-class coefficients for test-retest reliabilities ranged between 0·82 and 0·97. Three (shortness of breath, fear of progression, and hair problems) of the five multi-item scales showed responsiveness to change over time (p values <0·05), as did nine of 15 single symptom items. Four (coughing, shortness of breath, fear of progression, and surgery-related symptoms) of the five multi-item scales and ten of the 15 single symptom items were sensitive to known group differences (ie, lower vs higher Karnofsky performance status).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Results determined the psychometric properties of the updated lung cancer module, which is ready for use in international clinical studies.<h4>Funding</h4>EORTC Quality of Life Group.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate reported checklist use in emergency settings and examine the relationship with perioperative mortality in patients who had emergency laparotomy.<h4>Methods</h4>In two multinational cohort studies, adults undergoing emergency laparotomy were compared with those having elective gastrointestinal surgery. Relationships between reported checklist use and mortality were determined using multivariable logistic regression and bootstrapped simulation.<h4>Results</h4>Of 12 296 patients included from 76 countries, 4843 underwent emergency laparotomy. After adjusting for patient and disease factors, checklist use before emergency laparotomy was more common in countries with a high Human Development Index (HDI) (2455 of 2741, 89·6 per cent) compared with that in countries with a middle (753 of 1242, 60·6 per cent; odds ratio (OR) 0·17, 95 per cent c.i. 0·14 to 0·21, P < 0·001) or low (363 of 860, 42·2 per cent; OR 0·08, 0·07 to 0·10, P < 0·001) HDI.

We quantified the burden of SSI after gastrointestinal surgery in countries in all parts of the world.<h4>Methods</h4>This international, prospective, multicentre cohort study included consecutive patients undergoing elective or emergency gastrointestinal resection within 2-week time periods at any health-care facility in any country. Countries with participating centres were stratified into high-income, middle-income, and low-income groups according to the UN's Human Development Index (HDI). Data variables from the GlobalSurg 1 study and other studies that have been found to affect the likelihood of SSI were entered into risk adjustment models. The primary outcome measure was the 30-day SSI incidence (defined by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for superficial and deep incisional SSI). Relationships with explanatory variables were examined using Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02662231.<h4>Findings</h4>Between Jan 4, 2016, and July 31, 2016, 13 265 records were submitted for analysis. 12 539 patients from 343 hospitals in 66 countries were included. 7339 (58·5%) patient were from high-HDI countries (193 hospitals in 30 countries), 3918 (31·2%) patients were from middle-HDI countries (82 hospitals in 18 countries), and 1282 (10·2%) patients were from low-HDI countries (68 hospitals in 18 countries). In total, 1538 (12·3%) patients had SSI within 30 days of surgery. The incidence of SSI varied between countries with high (691 [9·4%] of 7339 patients), middle (549 [14·0%] of 3918 patients), and low (298 [23·2%] of 1282) HDI (p<0·001). The highest SSI incidence in each HDI group was after dirty surgery (102 [17·8%] of 574 patients in high-HDI countries; 74 [31·4%] of 236 patients in middle-HDI countries; 72 [39·8%] of 181 patients in low-HDI countries). Following risk factor adjustment, patients in low-HDI countries were at greatest risk of SSI (adjusted odds ratio 1·60, 95% credible interval 1·05-2·37; p=0·030). 132 (21·6%) of 610 patients with an SSI and a microbiology culture result had an infection that was resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic used. Resistant infections were detected in 49 (16·6%) of 295 patients in high-HDI countries, in 37 (19·8%) of 187 patients in middle-HDI countries, and in 46 (35·9%) of 128 patients in low-HDI countries (p<0·001).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Countries with a low HDI carry a disproportionately greater burden of SSI than countries with a middle or high HDI and might have higher rates of antibiotic resistance. In view of WHO recommendations on SSI prevention that highlight the absence of high-quality interventional research, urgent, pragmatic, randomised trials based in LMICs are needed to assess measures aiming to reduce this preventable complication.<h4>Funding</h4>DFID-MRC-Wellcome Trust Joint Global Health Trial Development Grant, National Institute of Health Research Global Health Research Unit Grant.",

Therefore, knowledge, practice, and attitudes of the public in Jordan regarding genetic testing were investigated. Individuals (N = 3,196) were questioned about the concepts of genetic testing and genetic counselors, if they underwent any genetic tests, the type of test, the method of consenting to the test, as well as their level of satisfaction with the privacy of the genetic testing service. The likelihood of pursuing predictive genetic testing for cancer was also investigated. Although almost 70 % of respondents knew the term \"genetic testing,\" only 18 % had undergone genetic testing, primarily the mandatory premarital test. In addition, there was a lack of general knowledge about genetic counselors. Many of those who had genetic testing (45 %) indicated they did not go through a consent process, and a lack of consent was significantly related to dissatisfaction with the privacy of the service. Approximately 55 % of respondents indicated they would potentially pursue predictive genetic testing for cancer. Going for routine health checkups was not significantly correlated with either actual or potential uptake of genetic testing, suggesting health care providers do not play an influential role in patients' testing decisions. Our results show a gap between the knowledge and uptake of genetic testing and may help to guide the design of effective strategies to initiate successful genetic counseling and testing services.",

                  "abstract": "The number of advanced heart failure patients who can receive a heart transplant is limited by a shortage of suitable organ donors. In efforts to expand the donor pool, alternative donation and procurement methods have been developed, including heart transplantation following donation after circulatory death (DCD HT). While short-term survival following DCD HT is non-inferior to heart transplantation with brain-dead donors, there may be an increased rate of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) associated with DCD HT allografts. The underlying etiology of PGD is multifactorial and incompletely understood. For DCD HT allografts, the period of warm ischemic injury during DCD procurement is a potential risk factor for PGD to which brain death allografts are not exposed. The functional warm ischemic time thus may be an important driver of PGD in DCD HT. However, the mechanisms underlying PGD in this clinical scenario are poorly understood at the molecular level. The work presented herein aims to describe the development and validation of a high-fidelity non-survival porcine model of DCD orthotopic heart transplantation. We hypothesize that the use of this translational large animal model is critical to elucidate molecular mechanisms contributing to PGD, as well as to investigate interventions designed to optimize allograft preservation and early performance. This model replicates the perioperative and surgical approach used in DCD HT clinically, with modifications to account for porcine anatomy and physiology. The development of this large animal surgical model will not only provide mechanistic insights into the development of PGD but also can be modified to enhance translational research efforts aimed at improving organ recovery following DCD HT.",

Life-threatening Cl2 exposures frequently occur in domestic and occupational environments, and in transportation accidents. Modeling the human etiology of Cl2-induced acute lung injury (ALI), forensic biomarkers, and targeted countermeasures development have been hampered by inadequate large animal models. The objective of this study was to develop a translational model of Cl2-induced ALI in swine to understand toxico-pathophysiology and evaluate whether it is suitable for screening potential medical countermeasures and to identify biomarkers useful for forensic analysis. Specific pathogen-free Yorkshire swine (30-40 kg) of either sex were exposed to Cl2 (≤240 ppm for 1 h) or filtered air under anesthesia and controlled mechanical ventilation. Exposure to Cl2 resulted in severe hypoxia and hypoxemia, increased airway resistance and peak inspiratory pressure, and decreased dynamic lung compliance. Cl2 exposure resulted in increased total leucocyte and neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, vascular leakage, and pulmonary edema compared with the air-exposed group. The model recapitulated all three key histopathological features of human ALI, such as neutrophilic alveolitis, deposition of hyaline membranes, and formation of microthrombi. Free and lipid-bound 2-chlorofatty acids and chlorotyrosine-modified proteins (3-chloro-l-tyrosine and 3,5-dichloro-l-tyrosine) were detected in plasma and lung tissue after Cl2 exposure. In this study, we developed a translational swine model that recapitulates key features of human Cl2 inhalation injury and is suitable for testing medical countermeasures, and validated chlorinated fatty acids and protein adducts as biomarkers of Cl2 inhalation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We established a swine model of chlorine gas-induced acute lung injury that exhibits several features of human acute lung injury and is suitable for screening potential medical countermeasures. We validated chlorinated fatty acids and protein adducts in plasma and lung samples as forensic biomarkers of chlorine inhalation.",

The effects of CS have been believed to be transient and benign. However, CS induces severe pain, blepharospasm, lachrymation, airway obstruction, and skin blisters. Frequent injuries and hospitalizations have been reported after exposure. We have identified the sensory neuronal ion channel, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), as a key CS target resulting in acute irritation and pain and also as a mediator of neurogenic inflammation. Here, we examined the effects of pharmacologic TRPA1 inhibition on CS-induced cutaneous injury. We modeled CS-induced cutaneous injury by applying 10 μl CS agent [200 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] to each side of the right ears of 8- to 9-week-old C57BL/6 male mice, whereas left ears were applied with solvent only (DMSO). The TRPA1 inhibitor HC-030031 or A-967079 was administered after CS exposure. CS exposure induced strong tissue swelling, plasma extravasation, and a dramatic increase in inflammatory cytokine levels in the mouse ear skin. We also showed that the effects of CS were not transient but caused persistent skin injuries. These injury parameters were reduced with TRPA1 inhibitor treatment. Further, we tested the pharmacologic activity of advanced TRPA1 antagonists in vitro. Our findings showed that TRPA1 is a crucial mediator of CS-induced nociception and tissue injury and that TRPA1 inhibitors are effective countermeasures that reduce key injury parameters when administered after exposure. Additional therapeutic efficacy studies with advanced TRPA1 antagonists and decontamination strategies are warranted. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 2-Chlorobenzalmalononitrile (CS) tear gas agent has been deployed as a crowd dispersion chemical agent in recent times. Exposure to CS tear gas agents has been believed to cause transient acute toxic effects that are minimal at most. Here we found that CS tear gas exposure causes both acute and persistent skin injuries and that treatment with transient receptor potential ion channel ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) antagonists ameliorated skin injuries.",

                  "abstract": "Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic surge in the hospitalization of critically ill patients and the global demand for mechanical ventilators, alternative strategies for device sharing were explored. We developed and assessed the performance of a system for shared ventilation that uses clinically available components to individualize tidal volumes under a variety of clinically relevant conditions. The feasibility of remote monitoring of ventilators was also assessed. Methods: By using existing resources and off-the-shelf components, a ventilator-sharing system (VSS) that ventilates 2 patients simultaneously with a single device, and a ventilator monitoring system (VMS) that remotely monitors pulmonary mechanics were developed. The feasibility and effectiveness of VSS and VMS were evaluated in benchtop testing using 2 test lungs on a single ventilator, and then performance was assessed in translational swine models of normal and impaired lung function. Results: In benchtop testing, VSS and VMS delivered the set individualized parameters with minimal % errors in test lungs under pressure- and volume-regulated ventilation modes, suggesting the highest precision and accuracy. In animal studies, the VSS and VMS successfully delivered the individualized mechanical ventilation parameters within clinically acceptable limits. Further, we found no statistically significant difference between the target and measured values. Conclusion: The VSS adequately ventilated 2 test lungs or animals with variable lung conditions. The VMS accurately displayed mechanical ventilation settings, parameters, and alarms. Both of these systems could be rapidly assembled for scaling up to ventilate several critically ill patients in a pandemic or mass casualty disaster situations by leveraging off-the-shelf and custom 3D printed components.",

Chlorine gas has several uses in water purification, sanitation, and industrial applications; however, it is a toxic inhalation hazard agent. Inhalation of chlorine gas, based on the concentration and duration of the exposure, causes a spectrum of symptoms, including but not limited to lacrimation, rhinorrhea, bronchospasm, cough, dyspnea, acute lung injury, death, and survivors develop signs of pulmonary fibrosis and reactive airway disease. Despite the use of chlorine gas as a chemical warfare agent since World War I and its known potential as an industrial hazard, there is no specific antidote. The resurgence of the use of chlorine gas as a chemical warfare agent in recent years has brought speculation of its use as weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, developing antidotes for chlorine gas-induced lung injuries remains the need of the hour. While some of the pre-clinical studies have made substantial progress in the understanding of chlorine gas-induced pulmonary pathophysiology and identifying potential medical countermeasure(s), yet none of the drug candidates are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this review, we summarized pathophysiology of chlorine gas-induced pulmonary injuries, pre-clinical animal models, development of a pipeline of potential medical countermeasures under FDA animal rule, and future directions for the development of antidotes for chlorine gas-induced lung injuries.",

There are no antidotes for the majority of the chemical threat agents and toxic inhalation hazards despite their use as WMDs for more than a century. Among several putative targets, evidence for transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels as mediators of injury by various inhalational chemical threat agents is emerging. TRP channels are expressed in the respiratory system and are essential for homeostasis. Among TRP channels, the body of literature supporting essential roles for TRPA1, TRPV1, and TRPV4 in pulmonary chemical injuries is abundant. TRP channels mediate their function through sensory neuronal and nonneuronal pathways. TRP channels play a crucial role in complex pulmonary pathophysiologic events including, but not limited to, increased intracellular calcium levels, signal transduction, recruitment of proinflammatory cells, neurogenic inflammatory pathways, cough reflex, hampered mucus clearance, disruption of the integrity of the epithelia, pulmonary edema, and fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the role of TRP channels in chemical threat agents-induced pulmonary injuries and how these channels may serve as medical countermeasure targets for broader indications.",

                  "abstract": "The skin is highly sensitive to the chemical warfare agent in mustard gas, sulfur mustard (SM) that initiates a delayed injury response characterized by erythema, inflammation and severe vesication (blistering). Although SM poses a continuing threat, used as recently as in the Syrian conflict, no mechanism-based antidotes against SM are available. Recent studies demonstrated that Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a chemosensory cation channel in sensory nerves innervating the skin, is activated by SM and 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), an SM analog, in vitro, suggesting it may promote vesicant injury. Here, we investigated the effects of TRPA1 inhibitors, and an inhibitor of Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP), a neurogenic inflammatory peptide released upon TRPA1 activation, in a CEES-induced mouse ear vesicant model (CEES-MEVM). TRPA1 inhibitors (HC-030031 and A-967079) and a CGRP inhibitor (MK-8825) reduced skin edema, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, CXCL1/KC), MMP-9, a protease implicated in skin damage, and improved histopathological outcomes. These findings suggest that TRPA1 and neurogenic inflammation contribute to the deleterious effects of vesicants in vivo, activated either directly by alkylation, or indirectly, by reactive intermediates or pro-inflammatory mediators. TRPA1 and CGRP inhibitors represent new leads that could be considered for validation and further development in other vesicant injury models.",

Eucalyptol interacts with the TRP cation channels among other targets, but it is unclear which of these mediates its anti-inflammatory effects. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Effects of eucalyptol were compared in wild-type and TRPM8 channel-deficient mice in two different models: footpad inflammation elicited by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and pulmonary inflammation following administration of LPS. Oedema formation, behavioural inflammatory pain responses, leukocyte infiltration, enzyme activities and cytokine and chemokine levels were measured. KEY RESULTS: In the CFA model, eucalyptol strongly attenuated oedema and mechanical allodynia and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6), effects comparable with those of ibuprofen. In the LPS model of pulmonary inflammation, eucalyptol treatment diminished leukocyte infiltration, myeloperoxidase activity and production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ and IL-6. Genetic deletion of TRPM8 channels abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of eucalyptol in both models. Eucalyptol was at least sixfold more potent on human, than on mouse TRPM8 channels. A metabolite of eucalyptol, 2-hydroxy-1,8-cineol, also activated human TRPM8 channels. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Among the pharmacological targets of eucalyptol, TRPM8 channels were essential for its anti-inflammatory effects in mice. Human TRPM8 channels are more sensitive to eucalyptol than rodent TRPM8 channels explaining the higher potency of eucalyptol in humans. Metabolites of eucalyptol could contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects. The development of more potent and selective TRPM8 agonists may yield novel anti-inflammatory agents.",

However, the effects of inhibition of multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are poorly understood in normal and inflamed conditions. We hypothesized that inflammation alters the pharmacokinetic parameters of ciprofloxacin; and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic indices, such as ratio of peak plasma concentration to minimum inhibitory concentration (C max/MIC) and ratio of area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) of ciprofloxacin will be improved with the co-administration of a MRP4 inhibitor, dipyridamole, in inflammatory conditions. METHODS: In this study, the role of MRP4 on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of ciprofloxacin was investigated by the co-administration of dipyridamole in rats with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. The pharmacokinetic parameters for ciprofloxacin were calculated by non-compartmental approach. MIC of ciprofloxacin was determined using broth microdilution technique. RESULTS: Induction of inflammation in rats resulted in marked reduction in C max and AUC; and an increase in the volume of distribution (V d/F) and clearance (Cl/F) of ciprofloxacin, compared to normal rats. Co-administration of dipyridamole with ciprofloxacin in inflamed rats resulted in a threefold increase in AUC, a twofold decrease in V d/F and a threefold decrease in Cl/F of ciprofloxacin with significantly prolonged half-life compared to inflamed rats who received ciprofloxacin alone. Co-administration of dipyridamole enhanced AUC/MIC values of ciprofloxacin in both normal and inflamed rats. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MRP4 inhibition increases the systemic exposure of ciprofloxacin in both normal and inflammatory conditions.",

Case numbers of poison ivy ACD are increasing due to growing biomass and geographical expansion of poison ivy and increasing content of the allergen, urushiol, likely attributable to rising atmospheric CO2 Severe and treatment-resistant itch is the major complaint of affected patients. However, because of limited clinical data and poorly characterized models, the pruritic mechanisms in poison ivy ACD remain unknown. Here, we aim to identify the mechanisms of itch in a mouse model of poison ivy ACD by transcriptomics, neuronal imaging, and behavioral analysis. Using transcriptome microarray analysis, we identified IL-33 as a key cytokine up-regulated in the inflamed skin of urushiol-challenged mice. We further found that the IL-33 receptor, ST2, is expressed in small to medium-sized dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, including neurons that innervate the skin. IL-33 induces Ca2+ influx into a subset of DRG neurons through neuronal ST2. Neutralizing antibodies against IL-33 or ST2 reduced scratching behavior and skin inflammation in urushiol-challenged mice. Injection of IL-33 into urushiol-challenged skin rapidly exacerbated itch-related scratching via ST2, in a histamine-independent manner. Targeted silencing of neuronal ST2 expression by intrathecal ST2 siRNA delivery significantly attenuated pruritic responses caused by urushiol-induced ACD. These results indicate that IL-33/ST2 signaling is functionally present in primary sensory neurons and contributes to pruritus in poison ivy ACD. Blocking IL-33/ST2 signaling may represent a therapeutic approach to ameliorate itch and skin inflammation related to poison ivy ACD.",

Large amounts of tear gas have been used in densely populated cities, including Cairo, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Manama (Bahrain), and Hong Kong. In the United States, tear gas was used extensively during recent riots in Ferguson, Missouri. Whereas tear gas deployment systems have rapidly improved-with aerial drone systems tested and requested by law enforcement-epidemiological and mechanistic research have lagged behind and have received little attention. Case studies and recent epidemiological studies revealed that tear gas agents can cause lung, cutaneous, and ocular injuries, with individuals affected by chronic morbidities at high risk for complications. Mechanistic studies identified the ion channels TRPV1 and TRPA1 as targets of capsaicin in pepper spray, and of the tear gas agents chloroacetophenone, CS, and CR. TRPV1 and TRPA1 localize to pain-sensing peripheral sensory neurons and have been linked to acute and chronic pain, cough, asthma, lung injury, dermatitis, itch, and neurodegeneration. In animal models, transient receptor potential inhibitors show promising effects as potential countermeasures against tear gas injuries. On the basis of the available data, a reassessment of the health risks of tear gas exposures in the civilian population is advised, and development of new countermeasures is proposed.",

Several of the algorithms used to standardize the doses of cytotoxic drugs utilize allometry, or the nonproportional relationships between anatomical and physiological variables, but the underlying basis for these relationships is poorly understood. The objective of this proof of concept study was to determine whether allometric equations explain the relationships between body weight, kidney weight, renal physiology, and clearance of a model, renally cleared anticancer agent in dogs. Postmortem body, kidney, and heart weights were collected from 364 dogs (127 juveniles and 237 adults, including 51 dogs ≥ 8 years of age). Renal physiological and cisplatin pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in ten intact male dogs including two juvenile and eight adult dogs (4-55 kg). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow, effective renal blood flow, renal cisplatin clearance, and total cisplatin clearance were allometrically related to body weight with powers of 0.75, 0.59, 0.61, 0.71, and 0.70, respectively. The similar values of these diverse mass exponents suggest a common underlying basis for the allometry of kidney size, renal physiology, and renal drug handling.",

The objective of this study was to determine which isoform of cytochrome P450 enzyme is responsible for the majority of vinblastine metabolism in dogs. A panel of eight recombinant canine cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A12, CYP3A26, CYP2B11, CYP2C41, CYP2C21 and CYP2D15) were incubated in vitro with vinblastine. Findings were confirmed by the use of canine polyclonal antibodies of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP3A12, CYP2B11 and CYP2C21) that were pre-incubated with individual and pooled hepatic microsomes that were purified from canine liver. Substrate depletion was observed in the presence of recombinant CYP3A12, whereas depletion did not substantially occur when microsomes were pre-incubated with polyclonal antibodies against CYP3A12. These findings confirmed that CYP3A12 is the major cytochrome P450 isoform responsible for the metabolism of vinblastine in dogs.",

It is currently unknown whether OxPAPC also contributes to inflammatory pain and peripheral neuronal excitability in these conditions. Here, we observed that OxPAPC dose-dependently and selectively activated human TRPA1 nociceptive ion channels expressed in HEK293 cells in vitro, without any effect on other TRP channels, including TRPV1, TRPV4 and TRPM8. OxPAPC agonist activity was dependent on essential cysteine and lysine residues within the N-terminus of the TRPA1 channel protein. OxPAPC activated calcium influx into a subset of mouse sensory neurons which were also sensitive to the TRPA1 agonist mustard oil. Neuronal OxPAPC responses were largely abolished in neurons isolated from TRPA1-deficient mice. Intraplantar injection of OxPAPC into the mouse hind paw induced acute pain and persistent mechanical hyperalgesia and this effect was attenuated by the TRPA1 inhibitor, HC-030031. More importantly, we found levels of OxPAPC to be significantly increased in inflamed tissue in a mouse model of chronic inflammatory pain, identified by the binding of an OxPAPC-specific antibody. These findings suggest that TRPA1 is a molecular target for OxPAPC and OxPAPC may contribute to chronic inflammatory pain through TRPA1 activation. Targeting against OxPAPC and TRPA1 signaling pathway may be promising in inflammatory pain treatment.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative bioavailability of GS for liquid, chewable, and tablet formulations containing GS sulfate or hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate. In a randomized cross-over design, supplements were administered daily for 8 days with a 1 wk washout period between treatments. Liquid or Tablet A was administered to four dogs, whereas Liquid or Tablet B was administered to four additional dogs. When nutraceutical exposure was normalized to the administered dose of GS free base, similar relative bioavailabilities were determined for all three formulations. However, the dose-normalized maximum plasma GS concentration was higher for the liquid supplement (5.5 ± 0.5 μg/mL) than for the two tablets (3.1 ± 0.6 and 2.1 ± 0.6 μg/mL, P < 0.001). Similarly, the time at which maximal plasma GS concentrations occurred was shorter for the liquid formulation (0.7 ± 0.5 hr) than for the two tablets (4.2 ± 0.6 and 5.0 ± 0.6 hr, P < 0.001).

Recent studies have shown that transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), an ion channel expressed in pulmonary tissues, is a crucial mediator of pressure-induced damage associated with ventilator-induced lung injury, heart failure, and infarction. Here, we examined the effects of two novel TRPV4 inhibitors in mice exposed to hydrochloric acid, mimicking acid exposure and acid aspiration injury, and to chlorine gas, a severe chemical threat with frequent exposures in domestic and occupational environments and in transportation accidents. Postexposure treatment with a TRPV4 inhibitor suppressed acid-induced pulmonary inflammation by diminishing neutrophils, macrophages, and associated chemokines and cytokines, while improving tissue pathology. These effects were recapitulated in TRPV4-deficient mice. TRPV4 inhibitors had similar anti-inflammatory effects in chlorine-exposed mice and inhibited vascular leakage, airway hyperreactivity, and increase in elastance, while improving blood oxygen saturation. In both models of lung injury we detected increased concentrations of N-acylamides, a class of endogenous TRP channel agonists. Taken together, we demonstrate that TRPV4 inhibitors are potent and efficacious countermeasures against severe chemical exposures, acting against exaggerated inflammatory responses, and protecting tissue barriers and cardiovascular function.",

The optimal chromatographic behavior of these analytes was achieved on pentafluorophenyl (PFP) propyl analytical column (5μm, 50×2.1mm) under isocratic elution of 0.75mL/min with a mobile phase of 5mM ammonium acetate and methanol. The samples were analyzed in positive ion, multiple reaction monitoring mode. The calibration curves were linear over 0.125-2ng/mL (lower calibration curve); 2-100ng/mL (higher calibration curve) and 0.125-5ng/mL for vinblastine and desacetylvinblastine in plasma, and over 1-2000ng/mL and 0.5-100ng/mL for vinblastine and desacetylvinblastine in urine samples, respectively. The limits of quantitation of vinblastine and desacetylvinblastine were 0.125ng/mL in both matrices. The intra and interday accuracy was above 89% and precision below 8.6% for both analytes in both matrices.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: Patients aged 21-40 years undergoing first autologous retrieval cycles resulting in ≥5 fertilized oocytes, with subsequent single blastocyst transfer in Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology clinics from 2016-2019. EXPOSURE: PGT-A using NGS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was cumulative live birth per retrieval. Secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth per transfer. RESULTS: A total of 56,469 retrieval cycles were included in the analysis. Retrieval cycles were stratified based on age (<35, 35-37, and 38-40 years) and exposure to PGT-A with NGS. Modified Poisson regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between PGT-A and cumulative live birth per retrieval while controlling for covariates. In this cohort, most cycles did not use PGT-A (n = 49,608; 88%). After adjusting for covariates, the use of PGT-A was associated with a slightly lower cumulative live birth in individuals aged <35 years (risk ratio [RR]: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.99) compared with no PGT, but higher cumulative live birth in ages 35-37 years (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.00-1.08), and 38-40 years (RR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.07-1.20). A subgroup analysis limited to freeze-all cycles (n = 29,041) showed that PGT-A was associated with higher cumulative live birth in individuals aged ≥35 years and was similar to no PGT in individuals aged <35 years. Miscarriage was significantly less likely in individuals aged ≥35 years using PGT-A compared with no PGT-A. CONCLUSION: In this large national database study, success rates in cycles using PGT-A were dependent on age. Cumulative live birth was observed to be significantly less likely in PGT-A cycles among individuals aged <35 years and more likely among individuals aged 38-40 years, compared with no PGT-A. In individuals with no fresh transfer, results were similar. Moreover, miscarriage was significantly less likely with PGT-A among individuals aged 35-40 years in a subgroup analysis of freeze-all cycles.",

Methods: Female YAs (N = 18; aged 21-36) with a history of cancer and oncology providers (N = 12) were recruited from an National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center in a state without insurance coverage for fertility preservation. YAs and providers completed individual interviews and a brief online assessment. Qualitative description using thematic analysis was used to identify, analyze, and report common themes. Descriptive statistics was used to characterize the sample. Results: Female YAs and oncology providers highlighted the critical role that high out-of-pocket costs play in YAs' fertility preservation decisions along with the value that enhanced insurance coverage for fertility preservation would have for increasing female YAs' access to and utilization of fertility preservation. Although providers were concerned about preservation costs for their patients, they reported that their concerns did not impact whether they referred interested female YAs to reproductive specialists. Oncology providers expressed concern about inequities in utilization of fertility preservation for female and racially/ethnically minoritized YAs that were exacerbated by the high out-of-pocket fertility preservation costs. Conclusion: Cost is a significant barrier to fertility preservation for female YA cancer patients. Female YAs of reproductive age may benefit from decision support tools to assist with balancing the cost of fertility preservation with their values and family building goals. Policy-relevant interventions may mitigate cost barriers and improve access to care.",

DESIGN: This cross-sectional study investigated the 100 most-viewed videos utilizing the #IVF hashtag on TikTok. Only videos in English or Spanish were included in the analysis. An automated web-scraping platform was used to extract information from these videos. Standardized video coding was used to evaluate the featured subject(s), phase of care and IVF outcomes from the videos. RESULTS: Videos meeting the inclusion criteria (n=93) had 731 million views, 91 million likes and 893,000 shares. Patients' personal stories about IVF are over-represented relative to videos created by healthcare professionals. #IVF videos popular on TikTok disproportionately depict same-sex couples (38.1%), gestational carriers (14.0%), multiple gestations (60.0%) and live births (89.3%) relative to real-world data. Among the videos making scientific claims (n=16), nearly all were moderately to highly accurate (93.8%). Most videos had a positive (55.9%) or neutral (5.5%) tone towards IVF. CONCLUSIONS: Popular #IVF videos on TikTok contribute to public discourse about infertility, and highlight demographics that have traditionally been under-represented in health care. Videos rarely focused on health education or made informational claims, with low scores on measures of quality of information and actionability. This gap represents an opportunity for health providers and educators to create more engaging and educational content to reach patients considering IVF.",

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using 2012-2015 Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcomes Reporting System data. SETTING: Fertility clinics. PATIENTS: To identify patients most likely to have PCOS, we included women with a diagnosis of ovulation disorder and serum antimüllerian hormone >4.45 ng/mL. Exclusion criteria included age ≥ 41 years, secondary diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve, preimplantation genetic testing, and missing BMI or primary outcome data. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Good perinatal outcome, defined as a singleton live birth at ≥ 37 weeks with birth weight ≥ 2,500 g and ≤ 4,000 g. RESULTS: The analysis included 9,521 fresh, autologous IVF cycles from 8,351 women. Among women with PCOS, the proportion of cycles with a good perinatal outcome was inversely associated with BMI: underweight 25.1%, normal weight 22.7%, overweight 18.9%, class I 18.4%, class II 14.9%, and class III or super obesity 12.2%. After adjusting for confounders, women in the highest BMI category had 51% reduced odds of a good perinatal outcome compared with normal weight women (adjusted odds ratio 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.67). CONCLUSIONS: Among women with PCOS undergoing fresh, autologous IVF, the odds of a good perinatal outcome decline with increasing BMI. Women with PCOS should be counseled that the odds of achieving a good perinatal outcome decrease as their weight increases.",

Oncofertility literature cites recall bias as a pitfall of retrospective surveys, but limited data exist to quantify this bias. Design: Retrospective secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data. Setting: Single academic medical center. Patient(s): Female oncology patients of reproductive age, 18–44 years old, at least 6 months past their last chemotherapy treatment. Intervention(s): Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s): Recall of details surrounding cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy regimens, recall of FP counseling and ovarian reserve testing, and rates of chart-documented FP counseling. Result(s): In total, 117 patients completed the survey, with 112 verified via chart review. When asked to report the chemotherapy regimen, 57% (64 of the 112) marked “I don't know/prefer not to say.” Regarding FP, 80% (90 of the 112) denied being offered counseling. Of the 37 (33%) who had documented FP conversations, 13 (35%) did not recall mention of fertility. Only 2 of 8 patients with ovarian reserve testing recalled this being performed at their initial visit. Multivariable logistic regression revealed older age was significantly associated with not being offered FP (odds ratio [OR] 0.87). Conclusion(s): Our results confirm that the accuracy of oncology patients’ reporting is limited by a poor recall, particularly regarding their specific chemotherapy regimen. More than 1 in 3 patients documented to have been offered FP counseling do not recall this discussion. Importantly, only one-third of cancer survivors had chart-documented FP counseling.

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess the association between AMH and live birth among women with elevated AMH undergoing first fresh IVF. Serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) correlates with oocyte yield during in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, there are limited data regarding IVF outcomes in women with elevated AMH levels. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinical Outcomes Reporting System database from 2012-2014. SETTING: Fertility clinics reporting to Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. PATIENTS: First, fresh, autologous IVF cycles with elevated AMH levels (≥5.0 ng/mL). Subanalyses were performed to examine patients with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds of live birth. RESULTS: Our cohort included 10,615 patients with elevated an AMH level, including 2,707 patients with PCOS only. The adjusted odds of live birth per initiated cycle were significantly lower per each unit increase in the AMH level (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.98). Increasing AMH level was associated with increased cancellation of fresh transfer (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.15) up to an AMH level of 12 ng/mL. The decrease in the live birth rate appears to be caused by the increasing incidence of cancellation of fresh transfer because the live birth rate per completed transfer was maintained. Similar trends were observed in the PCOS and non-PCOS subanalyses. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AMH levels of ≥5 ng/mL undergoing fresh, autologous IVF, each unit increase in AMH level is associated with a 3% decrease in odds of live birth because of the increased incidence of fresh embryo transfer cancellation.",

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using the 2012-2014 Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System database. SETTING: Fertility clinics reporting to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. PATIENTS: The analysis included 7,819 patients aged ≥41 years who underwent a first fresh, autologous IVF cycle during the study period. Cycles with preimplantation genetic testing were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Live birth rate. RESULTS: The empirical distribution of AMH was examined, and extreme values were observed. Therefore, the natural logarithm transformation of AMH (log-AMH) was used in all analyses. Before adjustment for covariates, a one-unit increase in log-AMH was associated with doubling of the odds of live birth up to a log-AMH of -0.34 (equivalently, AMH, 0.71 ng/mL; odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.66-2.46). Above an AMH level of 0.71 ng/mL, the odds of live birth increased by only 40% with each unit increase in log-AMH (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.22-1.61). After adjusting for covariates, the odds of live birth increased by 91% with each unit increase in log-AMH up to -0.34 (AMH, 0.71 ng/mL; OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.56-2.34). Above an AMH level of 0.71 ng/mL, the odds of live birth increased by only 32% with each unit increase in log-AMH (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.53). CONCLUSIONS: Among women aged ≥41 years undergoing fresh, autologous IVF, the odds of live birth significantly increase with increasing serum AMH level. As the AMH level increases above 0.71 ng/mL, the association maintains statistical significance, but the effect size is diminished.",

Currently, individualized prediction of a patient's risk of POI is challenging. METHODS: Authors of published studies examining POI after gonadotoxic therapy were contacted, and six authors shared their de-identified data (N = 435). A composite outcome for POI was determined for each patient and validated by 3 authors. The primary dataset was partitioned into training and test sets; random forest binary classifiers were trained, and mean prediction scores were computed. Institutional data collected from a cross-sectional survey of cancer survivors (N = 117) was used as another independent validation set. RESULTS: Our model predicted individualized risk of POI with an accuracy of 88% (area under the ROC 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.96; p < 0.001). Mean prediction scores for patients who developed POI and who did not were 0.60 and 0.38 (t-test p < 0.001), respectively. Highly weighted variables included age, chemotherapy dose, prior treatment, smoking, and baseline diminished ovarian reserve. CONCLUSION: We developed an ML-based model to estimate personalized risk of POI after chemotherapy. Our web-based calculator will be a user-friendly decision aid for individualizing risk prediction in oncofertility consultations.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infertility is a common late effect for cancer survivors. Whereas assisted reproductive technology has made it possible for survivors to take steps to preserve fertility before starting treatment, only a minority of patients proceed with preservation. Patient-, provider-, health system-, and societal-level barriers to fertility preservation (FP) exist. Oncofertility patient navigation is a valuable resource for addressing FP barriers. OBJECTIVES: To highlight the critical role of oncofertility patient navigation in addressing barriers to FP within an academic oncofertility program. METHODS: The role of the oncofertility patient navigator in reducing FP barriers, promoting informed decision-making, and ensuring program sustainability is described. Program metrics illustrating the impact of oncofertility patient navigation on referrals for FP counseling and access to FP in the last year also are provided. DISCUSSION: The oncofertility program at our academic adult and pediatric medical centers aims to facilitate rapid referral to fertility counseling and preservation services for postpubertal cancer patients. The patient navigator is integral to the success of the program. The navigator ensures that patients are: (1) well-informed about the potential impact of cancer on fertility and FP options, (2) aware of available resources (eg, financial) for pursuing FP, (3) able to access FP services if desired, and (4) well supported in making an informed FP decision. The inclusion of the patient navigator has led to an almost 2-fold increase in referrals for FP counseling in the past year over the historic annual average. CONCLUSIONS: Our institution's oncofertility program, with patient navigation at the core, provides a potential model for increasing patient access to oncofertility care and promoting program sustainability. Oncofertility patient navigation is a valuable resource for providing patients and families with education and support regarding FP decision-making, as well as addressing the multilevel barriers to FP.",

Anticipating increased use of OTC, we compare the cost-effectiveness of OC versus OTC for fertility preservation in oncofertility patients. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model to compare OC versus OTC was built from a payer perspective. Costs and probabilities were derived from the literature. The primary outcome for effectiveness was the percentage of patients who achieved live birth. Strategies were compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). All inputs were varied widely in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base case, the estimated cost for OC was $16,588 and for OTC $10,032, with 1.56% achieving live birth after OC, and 1.0% after OTC. OC was more costly but more effective than OTC, with an ICER of $1,163,954 per live birth. In sensitivity analyses, OC was less expensive than OTC if utilization was greater than 63%, cost of OC prior to chemotherapy was less than $8100, cost of laparoscopy was greater than $13,700, or standardized discounted costs were used. CONCLUSIONS: With current published prices and utilization, OC is more costly but more effective than OTC. OC becomes cost-saving with increased utilization, when cost of OC prior to chemotherapy is markedly low, cost of laparoscopy is high, or standardized discounted oncofertility pricing is assumed. We identify the critical thresholds of OC and OTC that should be met to deliver more cost-effective care for oncofertility patients.",

This is, in part, due to the work of members associated with the Oncofertility Consortium. METHODS: The Oncofertility Consortium is an international, interdisciplinary initiative originally designed to explore the urgent unmet need associated with the reproductive future of cancer survivors. As the strategies for fertility management were invented, developed or applied, the individuals for who the program offered hope, similarly expanded. As a community of practice, Consortium participants share information in an open and rapid manner to addresses the complex health care and quality-of-life issues of cancer, transgender and other patients. To ensure that the organization remains contemporary to the needs of the community, the field designed a fully inclusive mechanism for strategic planning and here present the findings of this process. RESULTS: This interprofessional network of medical specialists, scientists, and scholars in the law, medical ethics, religious studies and other disciplines associated with human interventions, explore the relationships between health, disease, survivorship, treatment, gender and reproductive longevity. CONCLUSION: The goals are to continually integrate the best science in the service of the needs of patients and build a community of care that is ready for the challenges of the field in the future.",

Little data exists on effects of paternal tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure prior to reproduction. This study determined if chronic THC exposure alters sperm DNA methylation (DNAm) and if such effects are intergenerationally transmitted. Adult male rats underwent oral gavage with THC or vehicle control. Differentially methylated (DM) loci in motile sperm were identified using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Another cohort was injected with vehicle or THC, and sperm DNAm was analyzed. Finally, THC-exposed and control adult male rats were mated with THC-naïve females. DNAm levels of target genes in brain tissues of the offspring were determined by pyrosequencing. RRBS identified 2,940 DM CpGs mapping to 627 genes. Significant hypermethylation was confirmed (p < 0.05) following oral THC administration for cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Por), involved in toxin processing and disorders of sexual development. Por hypermethylation was not observed after THC injection or in the subsequent generation. These results support that THC alters DNAm in sperm and that route of exposure can have differential effects. Although we did not observe evidence of intergenerational transmission of the DNAm change, larger studies are required to definitively exclude this possibility.",

The objective of our study was to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in patients with a low number of fertilized oocytes (< 4), comparing single blastocyst transfer to one or more cleavage embryo transfer. Results: We analyzed 6795 cycles from the 2014–2105 Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) registry. All patients were ≤ 38 years old, had less than four fertilized oocytes, and were undergoing first fresh in vitro fertilization (IVF) transfer. Primary outcomes were clinical pregnancy (CP), live birth (LB), and miscarriage rate in both cleavage stage transfer and single blastocyst transfer. A secondary outcome was the rate of twin gestation. The comparison of interest in day of transfer included (1) single blastocyst vs single cleavage and (2) single blastocyst vs multiple cleavage stage. The association between day of transfer and primary outcome was investigated using logistic regression, controlling for the age, race/ethnicity, BMI, smoking, gravidity, parity, infertility diagnoses, and assisted hatching. Single blastocyst transfer was associated with an increased odds of CP (adjusted OR 2.03) and LB (adjusted OR 1.86) when compared to single cleavage transfer, and no statistically significant association was observed when comparing single blastocyst transfer to multiple cleavage embryo transfer for CP (adjusted OR 0.94) and LB (adjusted OR = 0.88). The odds of having twins among single blastocyst transfer was significantly lower compared to those odds that among multiple cleavage stage transfer (unadjusted OR 0.09). Conclusions: While pregnancy outcomes are similar between single blastocyst and multiple cleavage embryo transfer, the twin rate is reduced significantly among the single blastocyst transfers in patients with a low number of fertilized oocytes.",

Evidence suggests that preconception exposure to these drugs alters offspring neurodevelopment. Epigenetics may in part facilitate heritability. We therefore compared effects of exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nicotine on DNA methylation in rat sperm at genes involved in neurodevelopment. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data from sperm of rats exposed to THC via oral gavage showed that seven neurodevelopmentally active genes were significantly differentially methylated versus controls. Pyrosequencing data revealed majority overlap in differential methylation in sperm from rats exposed to THC via injection as well as those exposed to nicotine. Neurodevelopmental genes including autism candidates are vulnerable to environmental exposures and common features may mediate this vulnerability. We discovered that autism candidate genes are significantly enriched for bivalent chromatin structure, suggesting this configuration may increase vulnerability of genes in sperm to disrupted methylation.",

Increasing the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) dose has been shown to adversely affect live birth rates in autologous cycles. Our objective is to assess whether this relationship holds true within the donor/recipient population. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENTS: Data from 2014-2016 included 8,627 fresh donor cycles. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Live birth, clinical pregnancy, and miscarriage rates. RESULTS: The mean donor age ± standard deviation (SD) was 25.8 ± 2.8 years. Donors underwent a median of 16 days (interquartile range [IQR] 12, 19) of stimulation with a median (IQR) total FSH dose and daily dose of 2,350.0 (1,800.0, 3,025.0) and 153.8 (113.2, 205.0) IU, respectively. The live birth rate was 56.7% per transfer. For every 500-unit increase in FSH dose, there was a 3% reduction in the odds of a live birth (odds ratio [OR] 0.97; 95% confidence interval 0.95, 0.99), and a 3% reduction in the odds of a clinical pregnancy (OR 0.97; 95% confidence interval 0.95, 0.99). Days of stimulation and average daily dose were not significantly associated with live birth or clinical pregnancy. No significant association was found between miscarriage rates and total FSH dose, days of stimulation, or average daily dose. CONCLUSION: This is a novel report of a negative association of total FSH dosage on fresh IVF live births, performed in the donor population to control for oocyte source and endometrial receptivity.",

Data validity is supported by significant correlations between THC exposure levels in humans and methylation for 177 genes, and substantial overlap in THC target genes in rat sperm (this study) and genes previously reported as having altered methylation in the brain of rat offspring born to parents both exposed to THC during adolescence. In humans, cannabis use was also associated with significantly lower sperm concentration. Findings point to possible pre-conception paternal reproductive risks associated with cannabis use.",

Little data exists on effects of paternal tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure prior to reproduction. This study determined if chronic THC exposure alters sperm DNA methylation (DNAm) and if such effects are intergenerationally transmitted. Adult male rats underwent oral gavage with THC or vehicle control. Differentially methylated (DM) loci in motile sperm were identified using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Another cohort was injected with vehicle or THC, and sperm DNAm was analyzed. Finally, THC-exposed and control adult male rats were mated with THC-naïve females. DNAm levels of target genes in brain tissues of the offspring were determined by pyrosequencing. RRBS identified 2,940 DM CpGs mapping to 627 genes. Significant hypermethylation was confirmed (p < 0.05) following oral THC administration for cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Por), involved in toxin processing and disorders of sexual development. Por hypermethylation was not observed after THC injection or in the subsequent generation. These results support that THC alters DNAm in sperm and that route of exposure can have differential effects. Although we did not observe evidence of intergenerational transmission of the DNAm change, larger studies are required to definitively exclude this possibility.",

                  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Infertility poses a substantial public health problem for women of reproductive age, in the United States and globally. Infertility can be overcome with a variety of emerging assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs). In vitro fertilization (IVF) currently represents the most commonly utilized method of ART and is typically associated with the highest clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate compared with other infertility treatment options. However, proper preconception evaluation and counseling is paramount for optimizing IVF and pregnancy outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to outline current guidelines and recommendations for comprehensive preconception evaluation before initiation of IVF. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Articles were obtained from PubMed, ACOG committee opinions 781 and 762, and relevant textbook chapters. RESULTS: A variety of recommendations and best practices exist for optimally managing patients seeking IVF. Special attention must be paid to the workup of certain patient populations, such as those with age older than 35 years, uterine abnormalities, comorbidities (especially hypertension, diabetes, and thrombophilias), and obesity. In addition, many lifestyle factors must be addressed before IVF initiation, such as smoking, illicit drug use, and inadequate nutrition. Preconception counseling and expectation management is key to optimizing pregnancy outcome. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: A myriad of patient and environmental factors impact the potential success rates of IVF in treating infertility. Providers must be equipped to provide data-driven, patient-centered counseling before initiation of IVF.",

Using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS), we recently demonstrated that cannabis use is associated with widespread DNA methylation changes in human and rat sperm. Discs-Large Associated Protein 2 (DLGAP2), involved in synapse organization, neuronal signaling, and strongly implicated in autism, exhibited significant hypomethylation (p < 0.05) at 17 CpG sites in human sperm. We successfully validated the differential methylation present in DLGAP2 for nine CpG sites located in intron seven (p < 0.05) using quantitative bisulphite pyrosequencing. Intron 7 DNA methylation and DLGAP2 expression in human conceptal brain tissue were inversely correlated (p < 0.01). Adult male rats exposed to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) showed differential DNA methylation at Dlgap2 in sperm (p < 0.03), as did the nucleus accumbens of rats whose fathers were exposed to THC prior to conception (p < 0.05).

                  "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the association of patient and IVF cycle characteristics with blastulation rate and formation of high-quality blastocysts Results: We analyzed autologous blastocyst cycles from 2013 to 2017. Cycles were subdivided into low (< 33%), intermediate (33–66%), and high (> 66%) blastulation rates. Embryo quality was assigned by embryologists using Gardner Criteria. R statistical package was used, and the blastulation groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. The Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. One hundred seventeen IVF cycles met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 20 (17.1%) had low, 74 (63.2%) had intermediate, and 23 (19.7%) had high blastulation rates. Low blastulation rate was associated with a lower number of blastocysts, including fewer high-quality blastocysts. The mean number of oocytes retrieved was highest (18.1) in the group with the lowest blastulation rate, and lowest (13.4) in those with the highest blastulation rate, although this did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant differences between blastulation rates and age, gravidity, prior live birth, anti-mullerian hormone, estradiol and progesterone levels on the day of ovulation trigger, follicle-stimulating hormone dose, or fertility diagnosis. Conclusions: High blastulation rate is associated with a greater number of blastocysts, including a greater number of high-quality blastocysts. Higher oocyte yield, however, is not associated with improved blastulation rates. Blastulation rates, blastocyst number, and quality remain difficult to predict based on cycle characteristics alone, and oocyte yield may not be an accurate predictor of either outcome.",

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: None. PATIENT(S): Registry data on 82,935 patient cycles from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART). INTERVENTION(S): All first fresh autologous IVF cycles were analyzed and compared to first FET cycles after a freeze-all first IVF stimulation. The cycles were subdivided into cohorts based upon the number of oocytes retrieved (OR): 1-5 (low), 6-14 (intermediate), and 15+ (high responders). Univariate analyses were performed on cycle characteristics, and multivariable regression analyses were performed on outcome data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live-birth rate (LBR). RESULTS: Of the 82,935 cycles analyzed, 69,102 patients had their first fresh transfer, and 13,833 had a first FET. High responders were found to have a higher CPR and LBR in the FET cycles compared with the fresh ET cycles (61.5 vs. 57.4%; 52.0 vs. 48.9%). In intermediate responders, both CPR and LBR were higher after fresh ET compared with FET (49.6% vs. 44.2%; 41.2 vs. 35.3%). Similarly, in low responders, CPR and LBR were higher after fresh compared with FET (33.2% vs. 15.9%; 25.9% vs. 11.5%). CONCLUSION(S): A freeze-all strategy is beneficial in high responders but not in intermediate or low responders, thus refuting the idea that freeze-all cycles are preferable for all patients.",

CONCLUSION(S): The majority of donor cleavage-stage transfers are compliant with current guidelines, but the transfer of two embryos results in a significantly higher MPR compared with single-embryo transfer.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Percentage of compliant cycles, multiple pregnancy rate (PR). RESULT(S): Between 2011 and 2012, a total of 59,689 fresh first autologous cycles were analyzed. Among cleavage-stage ET cycles, the noncompliance rate ranged from 10%-27.4% depending on the age group. The multiple PR was significantly increased in noncompliant cycles involving patients <35 years (38.1% vs. 28.7%) and 35-37 years (35.4% vs. 24.5%) compared with compliant cycles. Among blastocyst-stage ET cycles, the highest rate of noncompliance was seen in patients <35 years old (71%), which resulted in a statistically higher multiple PR (48.3% vs. 2.8%) compared with compliant cycles. Far fewer cycles were noncompliant in patients 35-40 years of age. In a subanalysis of compliant cycles, transferring two blastocyst embryos in patients 35-37 years and 38-40 years resulted in a higher live birth rate compared with the transfer of one embryo (50.4% vs. 40.9% and 42.1% vs. 30.0%, respectively) but the multiple PR was also significantly higher (40.5% vs. 1.7% and 34.0% vs. 2.0%, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Most first fresh autologous IVF cycles performed from 2011-2012 were compliant with ASRM/SART guidelines, except those that involved a blastocyst ET in patients <35 years. Despite compliance, cycles that involved the transfer of >1 embryo resulted in a high multiple PR, whereas noncompliant cycles resulted in an even more remarkable multiple PR for both cleavage and blastocyst-stage embryos. Clinics need to be more compliant with ET limits and ASRM/SART need to consider revising their guidelines to limit the number of blastocyst transfer to one in patients ≤40 years of age undergoing their first IVF cycle. Furthermore, decreasing the number of cleavage-stage embryos transferred in patients ≤40 years of age should also be considered.",

RESULT(S): Success rates and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all pregnancy outcomes were most favorable in cohorts with low and normal BMIs and progressively worsened as BMI increased. Obesity also had a negative impact on IVF outcomes in cycles performed for PCOS and male-factor infertility, although it did not always reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION(S): Success rates in fresh autologous cycles, including those done for specifically PCOS or male-factor infertility, are highest in those with low and normal BMIs. Furthermore, there is a progressive and statistically significant worsening of outcomes in groups with higher BMIs. More research is needed to determine the causes and extent of the influence of BMI on IVF success rates in other patient populations.",

Here, we show that a CDRH3-dominated anti-CD4-BS bNAb, CH103, establishes quaternary interaction despite regular-length FRH3 and CDRH1. This quaternary interaction is critical for neutralization and is primarily mediated by two FRH3 acidic residues that were sequentially acquired and subjected to strong positive selection during CH103 maturation. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures confirmed the role of the two FRH3 acidic residues in mediating quaternary contact and demonstrated that CH103 reaches the adjacent gp120 protomer by virtue of its unique angle of approach. Thus, the acquisition of quaternary interaction may constitute a key step in the lineage maturation of a broad and potent HIV-1 neutralizing antibody.",

                  "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, with new variants emerging that evade pre-existing immunity and limit the efficacy of existing vaccines. One approach toward developing superior, variant-proof vaccines is to engineer immunogens that preferentially elicit antibodies with broad cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants by targeting conserved epitopes on spike. The inner and outer faces of the receptor binding domain (RBD) are two such conserved regions targeted by antibodies that recognize diverse human and animal coronaviruses. To promote the elicitation of such antibodies by vaccination, we engineered \"resurfaced\" RBD immunogens that contained mutations at exposed RBD residues outside the target epitopes. In the context of pre-existing immunity, these vaccine candidates aim to disfavor the elicitation of strain-specific antibodies against the immunodominant receptor binding motif (RBM) while boosting the induction of inner and outer face antibodies. The engineered resurfaced RBD immunogens were stable, lacked binding to monoclonal antibodies with limited breadth, and maintained strong interactions with target broadly neutralizing antibodies. When used as vaccines, they limited humoral responses against the RBM as intended. Multimerization on nanoparticles further increased the immunogenicity of the resurfaced RBD immunogens, thus supporting resurfacing as a promising immunogen design approach to rationally shift natural immune responses to develop more protective vaccines.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus to cause significant human disease over the last two decades. Despite their success in preventing serious disease, current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines must be updated regularly to match the circulating strains for continued protection. Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop vaccines that protect more broadly against SARS-CoV-2, its variants, and other pre-emergent coronaviruses. This may be achieved by preferentially eliciting antibodies against conserved regions of the spike protein that decorates the virus. Toward this goal, we engineered vaccine candidates to target the conserved inner and outer domains of the Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2, by altering the surface of the wild-type protein such that strain-specific antibodies that bind outside these regions are no longer recognized. When used in animals with pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 immunity, these molecules reduce the elicitation of variant-specific antibodies, thus providing a blueprint to alter the natural immunodominance hierarchies of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.",

However, in light of the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) that can cause COVID-19, it is essential that we understand how immunization with spike protein elicits neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Here, we compared immunization of macaques with mRNA vaccines expressing ancestral spike protein with or without diproline substitutions, showing that the diproline substitutions were not required for protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge or induction of broadly neutralizing B cell lineages. One group of nAbs elicited by the ancestral spike protein lacking diproline substitutions targeted the outer face of the receptor binding domain (RBD), neutralized all tested SARS-CoV-2 VOC pseudotyped viruses including Omicron XBB.1.5 in vitro, but lacked cross-sarbecovirus neutralization. Structural analysis showed that the macaque nAbs that could broadly neutralize VOCs bound to the same epitope as a human nAb, DH1193. In contrast, vaccine-induced antibodies that targeted the RBD inner face neutralized multiple sarbecoviruses, protected mice from bat CoV RsSHC014 challenge, but lacked Omicron variant neutralization. Thus, ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccines lacking proline substitutions can induce B cell lineages binding to distinct RBD sites that either broadly neutralize animal and human sarbecoviruses or neutralize recent Omicron VOCs. Thus, the use of a nonstabilized spike protein design in some COVID-19 vaccines does not preclude the elicitation of broad sarbecovirus and broad VOC nAbs.",

The receptor-binding gp120 subunit of Env forms a heterodimer with gp41. The gp120/gp41 heterodimer assembles into a homotrimer, in which FP is accessible for antibody binding. Env conformational changes or \"opening\" that follow receptor binding result in FP relocating to a newly formed interprotomer pocket at the gp41-gp120 interface where it is sterically inaccessible to antibodies. The mechanistic steps connecting the entry-related transition of antibody accessible-to-inaccessible FP configurations remain unresolved. Here, using SOSIP-stabilized Env ectodomains, we visualize that the FP remains accessible for antibody binding despite substantial receptor-induced Env opening. We delineate stepwise Env opening from its closed state to a functional CD4-bound symmetrically open Env in which we show that FP was accessible for antibody binding. We define downstream re-organizations that lead to the formation of a gp120/gp41 cavity into which the FP buries to become inaccessible for antibody binding. These findings improve our understanding of HIV-1 entry and delineate the entry-related conformational trajectory of a key site of HIV vulnerability to neutralizing antibody.",

It is actively transported onto mucosal surfaces as secretory IgA (sIgA) which plays an integral role in protection against enteric pathogens, particularly in young children. Therapeutic strategies that deliver engineered, potently neutralizing antibodies directly into the infant intestine through breast milk could provide enhanced antimicrobial protection for neonates. Here, we developed a murine model of maternal protective transfer against human rotavirus (RV) using systemic administration of a dimeric IgA monoclonal antibody (mAb). First, we showed that systemically administered dIgA passively transferred into breast milk and the stomach of suckling pups in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we optimized the recombinant production of a potently RV-neutralizing, VP4-specific dIgA (mAb41) antibody. We then demonstrated that systemic administration of dIgA and IgG mAb41 in lactating dams conferred protection from RV-induced diarrhea in suckling pups, with dIgA resulting in lower diarrhea incidence from IgG. Systemic delivery of engineered antimicrobial dIgA mAbs should be considered as an effective strategy for sIgA delivery to the infant gastrointestinal tract via breast milk to increase protection against enteric pathogens.",

Here, to precisely engineer bnAb boosting immunogens, we use molecular dynamics simulations to examine encounter states that form when antibodies collide with the HIV-1 Envelope (Env). By mapping how bnAbs use encounter states to find their bound states, we identify Env mutations predicted to select for specific antibody mutations in two HIV-1 bnAb B cell lineages. The Env mutations encode antibody affinity gains and select for desired antibody mutations in vivo.

Using LIBRA-seq (linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing) data for the B cell repertoire of an individual chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we identified a lineage of IgG3 antibodies predicted to bind to HIV-1 Envelope (Env) and influenza A Hemagglutinin (HA). Two lineage members, antibodies 2526 and 546, were confirmed to bind to a large panel of diverse antigens, including several strains of HIV-1 Env, influenza HA, coronavirus (CoV) spike, hepatitis C virus (HCV) E protein, Nipah virus (NiV) F protein, and Langya virus (LayV) F protein. We found that both antibodies bind to complex glycans on the antigenic surfaces. Antibody 2526 targets the stem region of influenza HA and the N-terminal domain (NTD) region of SARS-CoV-2 spike. A crystal structure of 2526 Fab bound to mannose revealed the presence of a glycan-binding pocket on the light chain. Antibody 2526 cross-reacted with antigens from multiple pathogens and displayed no signs of autoreactivity. These features distinguish antibody 2526 from previously described glycan-reactive antibodies. Further study of this antibody class may aid in the selection and engineering of broadly reactive antibody therapeutics and can inform the development of effective vaccines with exceptional breadth of pathogen coverage.",

Thus, immunogen design aims to mimic the closed Env conformation as preferred target for eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Here we identify incompletely closed Env conformations of 6 out of 13 transmitted/founder (T/F) strains that are sensitive to antibodies that recognize internal epitopes typically exposed on open Envs. A 3.6 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of unliganded, incompletely closed T/F Envs (1059-SOSIP) reveals protomer motion that increased sampling of states with incompletely closed trimer apex. We reconstruct de novo the post-transmission evolutionary pathway of a second T/F. Evolved viruses exhibit increased Env resistance to cold, soluble CD4 and 19b, all of which correlate with closing of the adapted Env trimer. Lastly, we show that the ultra-broad N6 bnAb efficiently recognizes different Env conformations and exhibits improved antiviral breadth against VRC01-resistant Envs isolated during the first-in-humans antibody-mediated-prevention trial.",

In two distinct Env variants, we detected a transition that correlated with known Env structure rearrangements with a time constant in the hundreds of microseconds range. A previously unknown structural transition was also observed, which occurred with a time constant below 10 μs, and involved an order-to-disorder transition in the trimer apex. Using this information, we engineered an Env SOSIP construct that locks the trimer in the prefusion closed state by connecting adjacent protomers via disulfides.

To precisely engineer bnAb boosting immunogens, we used molecular dynamics simulations to examine encounter states that form when antibodies collide with the HIV-1 Envelope (Env).

Here, we compare immunization of macaques with mRNA vaccines expressing ancestral spike either including or lacking diproline substitutions, and show the diproline substitutions were not required for protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge or induction of broadly neutralizing B cell lineages. One group of nAbs elicited by the ancestral spike lacking diproline substitutions targeted the outer face of the receptor binding domain (RBD), neutralized all tested SARS-CoV-2 VOCs including Omicron XBB.1.5, but lacked cross-Sarbecovirus neutralization. Structural analysis showed that the macaque broad SARS-CoV-2 VOC nAbs bound to the same epitope as a human broad SARS-CoV-2 VOC nAb, DH1193. Vaccine-induced antibodies that targeted the RBD inner face neutralized multiple Sarbecoviruses, protected mice from bat CoV RsSHC014 challenge, but lacked Omicron variant neutralization. Thus, ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike lacking proline substitutions encoded by nucleoside-modified mRNA can induce B cell lineages binding to distinct RBD sites that either broadly neutralize animal and human Sarbecoviruses or recent Omicron VOCs.",

Envs of most primary HIV-1 strains exist in a closed conformation and occasionally sample more open states. Thus, current knowledge guides immunogen design to mimic the closed Env conformation as the preferred target for eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to block HIV-1 entry. Here we show that Env-preferred conformations of 6 out of 13 (46%) transmitted/founder (T/F) strains tested are incompletely closed. As a result, entry of these T/Fs into target cells is sensitive to antibodies that recognize internal epitopes exposed on open Env conformations. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of unliganded, incompletely closed T/F Envs (1059-SOSIP) at 3.6 Å resolution exhibits an asymmetric configuration of Env protomers with increased sampling of states with incompletely closed trimer apex. Double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy provided further evidence for enriched occupancy of more open Env conformations. Consistent with conformational flexibility, 1059 Envs were associated with resistance to most bnAbs that exhibit reduced potency against functional Env intermediates. To follow the fate of incompletely closed Env in patients, we reconstructed de novo the post-transmission evolutionary pathway of a second T/F Env (CH040), which is sensitive to the V3-targeting antibody 19b and highly resistant to most bnAbs. Evolved viruses exhibited increased resistance to cold, soluble CD4 and 19b, all of which correlate with closing of the adapted Env trimer. Lastly, we show a correlation between efficient neutralization of multiple Env conformations and increased antiviral breadth of CD4-binding site (CD4bs) bnAbs. In particular, N6 bnAb, which uniquely recognizes different Env conformations, efficiently neutralizes 50% of the HIV-1 strains that were resistant to VRC01 and transmitted during the first-in-humans antibody-mediated prevention trial (HVTN 704). VRC01-resistant Envs are incompletely closed based on their sensitivity to cold and on partial sensitivity to antibodies targeting internal, typically occluded, epitopes. Most VRC01-resistant Envs retain the VRC01 epitope according to VRC01 binding to their gp120 subunit at concentrations that have no significant effect on virus entry, and they exhibit cross resistance to other CD4bs bnAbs that poorly recognize functional Env intermediates. Our findings refine current knowledge of Env conformational states and provide guidance for developing new strategies for bnAb immunotherapy and Env-based immunogen design.",

Paramyxoviruses present two glycoproteins on their surface, known as attachment and fusion proteins, that mediate entry into cells and constitute the primary antigenic targets for immune response. Here, we determine cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the uncleaved LayV fusion protein (F) ectodomain in pre- and postfusion conformations. The LayV-F protein exhibits pre- and postfusion architectures that, despite being highly conserved across paramyxoviruses, show differences in their surface properties, in particular at the apex of the prefusion trimer, that may contribute to antigenic variability. While dramatic conformational changes were visualized between the pre- and postfusion forms of the LayV-F protein, several domains remained invariant, held together by highly conserved disulfides. The LayV-F fusion peptide (FP) is buried within a highly conserved, hydrophobic interprotomer pocket in the prefusion state and is notably less flexible than the rest of the protein, highlighting its \"spring-loaded\" state and suggesting that the mechanism of pre-to-post transition must involve perturbations to the pocket and release of the fusion peptide. Together, these results offer a structural basis for how the Langya virus fusion protein compares to its Henipavirus relatives and propose a mechanism for the initial step of pre- to postfusion conversion that may apply more broadly to paramyxoviruses. IMPORTANCE The Henipavirus genus is quickly expanding into new animal hosts and geographic locations. This study compares the structure and antigenicity of the Langya virus fusion protein to other henipaviruses, which have important vaccine and therapeutic development implications. Furthermore, the study proposes a new mechanism to explain the early steps of the fusion initiation process that can be more broadly applied to the Paramyxoviridae family.",

Although significant progress has been made in understanding the structures of various Env conformations and transition intermediates that occur within the millisecond timescale, faster transitions in the microsecond timescale have not yet been observed. In this study, we employed time-resolved, temperature-jump small angle X-ray scattering to monitor structural rearrangements in an HIV-1 Env ectodomain construct with microsecond precision. We detected a transition correlated with Env opening that occurs in the hundreds of microseconds range and another more rapid transition that preceded this opening. Model fitting indicated that the early rapid transition involved an order-to-disorder transition in the trimer apex loop contacts, suggesting that conventional conformation-locking design strategies that target the allosteric machinery may be ineffective in preventing this movement. Utilizing this information, we engineered an envelope that locks the apex loop contacts to the adjacent protomer. This modification resulted in significant angle-of-approach shifts in the interaction of a neutralizing antibody. Our findings imply that blocking the intermediate state could be crucial for inducing antibodies with the appropriate bound state orientation through vaccination.",

In some individuals broadly neutralizing antibodies develop to recognize rapidly mutating pathogens with extensive sequence diversity.

Here, we determine structures of antibodies in complex with HIV-1 Envelope for all observed members and ancestral states of the broadly neutralizing HIV-1 V3-glycan targeting DH270 antibody clonal B cell lineage. These structures track the development of neutralization breadth from the unmutated common ancestor and define affinity maturation at high spatial resolution. By elucidating contacts mediated by key mutations at different stages of antibody development we identified sites on the epitope-paratope interface that are the focus of affinity optimization.

Here, we investigate the antibody repertoire of a chronically HIV-1/HCV co-infected individual using linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing (LIBRA-seq). We identify five HIV-1/HCV cross-reactive antibodies demonstrating binding and functional cross-reactivity between HIV-1 and HCV envelope glycoproteins. All five antibodies show exceptional HCV neutralization breadth and effector functions against both HIV-1 and HCV. One antibody, mAb688, also cross-reacts with influenza and coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We examine the development of these antibodies using next-generation sequencing analysis and lineage tracing and find that somatic hypermutation established and enhanced this reactivity. These antibodies provide a potential future direction for therapeutic and vaccine development against current and emerging infectious diseases.

Despite advances in protein engineering, many Env proteins remain recalcitrant to recombinant expression due to their inherent metastability, making biochemical and immunological experiments impractical or impossible. Here, we report a novel proline stabilization strategy to facilitate the production of prefusion Env trimers. This approach, termed \"2P,\" works synergistically with previously described SOSIP mutations and dramatically increases the yield of recombinantly expressed Env ectodomains without altering the antigenic or conformational properties of near-native Env. We determined that the 2P mutations function by enhancing the durability of the prefusion conformation and that this stabilization strategy is broadly applicable to evolutionarily and antigenically diverse Env constructs. These findings provide a new Env stabilization platform to facilitate biochemical research and expand the number of Env variants that can be developed as future HIV-1 vaccine candidates. IMPORTANCE Recent estimates have placed the number of new human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections at approximately 1.5 million per year, emphasizing the ongoing and urgent need for an effective vaccine. The envelope (Env) glycoprotein is the main focus of HIV-1 vaccine development, but, due to its inherent metastability, many Env variants are difficult to recombinantly express in the relatively large quantities that are required for biochemical studies and animal trials.

Non-native pairing of public heavy and light chains from different individuals suggested functional complementation of sequences within this public antibody clonotype. The strength of antigen recognition appeared to be dependent on the specific antibody light chain used, but not on other sequence features such as native-antibody or germline sequence identity. Understanding the determinants of antibody clonotype \"publicness\" can provide insights into the fundamental rules of host-pathogen interactions at the population level, with implications for clonotype-specific vaccine development.",

To understand how this glycan can be recognized, here we isolate two lineages of glycan276-dependent CD4bs antibodies. Antibody CH540-VRC40.01 (named for donor-lineage.clone) neutralizes 81% of a panel of 208 diverse strains, while antibody CH314-VRC33.01 neutralizes 45%. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of these two antibodies and 179NC75, a previously identified glycan276-dependent CD4bs antibody, in complex with HIV-envelope trimer reveal substantially different modes of glycan276 recognition. Despite these differences, binding of glycan276-dependent antibodies maintains a glycan276 conformation similar to that observed in the absence of glycan276-binding antibodies. By contrast, glycan276-independent CD4bs antibodies, such as VRC01, displace glycan276 upon binding. These results provide a foundation for understanding antibody recognition of glycan276 and suggest its presence may be crucial for priming immunogens seeking to initiate broad CD4bs recognition.",

Vaccines that elicit protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses that circulate in animals have the potential to prevent future pandemics. Here we show that the immunization of macaques with nanoparticles conjugated with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, and adjuvanted with 3M-052 and alum, elicits cross-neutralizing antibody responses against bat coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (including the B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variants). Vaccination of macaques with these nanoparticles resulted in a 50% inhibitory reciprocal serum dilution (ID<sub>50</sub>) neutralization titre of 47,216 (geometric mean) for SARS-CoV-2, as well as in protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Nucleoside-modified mRNAs that encode a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric receptor-binding domain also induced cross-neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses, albeit at lower titres than achieved with the nanoparticles. These results demonstrate that current mRNA-based vaccines may provide some protection from future outbreaks of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, and provide a multimeric protein platform for the further development of vaccines against multiple (or all) betacoronaviruses.",

Vaccines that elicit protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs circulating in animals have the potential to prevent future betaCoV pandemics. Here, we show that immunization of macaques with a multimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) nanoparticle adjuvanted with 3M-052-Alum elicited cross-neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, batCoVs and the UK B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 mutant virus. Nanoparticle vaccination resulted in a SARS-CoV-2 reciprocal geometric mean neutralization titer of 47,216, and robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaque upper and lower respiratory tracts. Importantly, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric RBD protein also induced SARS-CoV-1 and batCoV cross-neutralizing antibodies, albeit at lower titers. These results demonstrate current mRNA vaccines may provide some protection from future zoonotic betaCoV outbreaks, and provide a platform for further development of pan-betaCoV nanoparticle vaccines.",

Thus, dissecting the bNAb response in VCs will provide key information about what constitutes an effective humoral response to natural HIV-1 infection. In this study, we identified a polyclonal bNAb response to natural HIV-1 infection targeting CD4 binding site (CD4bs), V3-glycan, gp120-gp41 interface and membrane-proximal external region (MPER) epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope (Env). The polyclonal antiviral antibody (Ab) response also included antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis of clade AE, B and C viruses, consistent with both the Fv and Fc domain contributing to function. Sequence analysis of envs from one of the VCs revealed features consistent with potential immune pressure and virus escape from V3-glycan targeting bNAbs. Epitope mapping of the polyclonal bNAb response in VCs with bNAb activity highlighted the presence of gp120-gp41 interface and CD4bs antibody classes with similar binding profiles to known potent bNAbs.

Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically reduced population of the 'up' state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in 'up' state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element.

                  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is the design of immunogens that induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). However, vaccination of humans has not resulted in the induction of affinity-matured and potent HIV-1 bnAbs. To devise effective vaccine strategies, we previously determined the maturation pathway of select HIV-1 bnAbs from acute infection through neutralizing antibody development. During their evolution, bnAbs acquire an abundance of improbable amino acid substitutions as a result of nucleotide mutations at variable region sequences rarely targeted by activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the enzyme responsible for antibody mutation. A subset of improbable mutations is essential for broad neutralization activity, and their acquisition represents a key roadblock to bnAb development. RATIONALE: Current bnAb lineage-based vaccine strategies can initiate bnAb lineage development in animal models but have not specifically elicited the improbable mutations required for neutralization breadth. Induction of bnAbs requires vaccine strategies that specifically engage bnAb precursors and subsequently select for improbable mutations required for broadly neutralizing activity. We hypothesized that vaccination with immunogens that bind with moderate to high affinity to bnAb B cell precursors, and with higher affinity to precursors that have acquired improbable mutations, could initiate bnAb B cell lineages and select for key improbable mutations required for bnAb development. RESULTS: We elicited serum neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies in human bnAb precursor knock-in mice and wild-type macaques vaccinated with immunogens designed to select for improbable mutations. We designed two HIV-1 envelope immunogens that bound precursor B cells of either a CD4 binding site or V3-glycan bnAb lineage. In vitro, these immunogens bound more strongly to bnAb precursors once the precursor acquired the desired improbable mutations. Vaccination of macaques with the CD4 binding site–targeting immunogen induced CD4 binding site serum neutralizing antibodies. Antibody sequences elicited in human bnAb precursor knock-in mice encoded functional improbable mutations critical for bnAb development. In bnAb precursor knock-in mice, we isolated a vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibody bearing functional improbable mutations that was capable of neutralizing multiple HIV-1 global isolates. Structures of a bnAb precursor, a bnAb, and the vaccine-elicited antibody revealed the precise roles that acquired improbable mutations played in recognizing the HIV-1 envelope. Thus, our immunogens elicited antibody responses in macaques and knock-in mice that exhibited the mutational patterns, structural characteristics, or neutralization profiles of nascent broadly neutralizing antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our study represents a proof of concept for targeted selection of improbable mutations to guide antibody affinity maturation. Moreover, this study demonstrates a rational strategy for sequential immunogen design to circumvent the difficult roadblocks in HIV-1 bnAb induction by vaccination. We show that immunogens should exhibit differences in affinity across antibody maturation stages where improbable mutations are necessary for the desired antibody function.

                  "abstract": "The CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is susceptible to multiple lineages of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that are attractive to elicit with vaccines. The CH235 lineage (VH1-46) of CD4bs bnAbs is particularly attractive because the most mature members neutralize 90% of circulating strains, do not possess long HCDR3 regions, and do not contain insertions and deletions that may be difficult to induce. We used virus neutralization to measure the interaction of CH235 unmutated common ancestor (CH235 UCA) with functional Env trimers on infectious virions to guide immunogen design for this bnAb lineage. Two Env mutations were identified, one in loop D (N279K) and another in V5 (G458Y), that acted synergistically to render autologous CH505 transmitted/founder virus susceptible to neutralization by CH235 UCA. Man5-enriched N-glycans provided additional synergy for neutralization. CH235 UCA bound with nanomolar affinity to corresponding soluble native-like Env trimers as candidate immunogens. A cryo-EM structure of CH235 UCA bound to Man5-enriched CH505.N279K.G458Y.SOSIP.664 revealed interactions of the antibody light chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR L3) with the engineered Env loops D and V5. These results demonstrate that virus neutralization can directly inform vaccine design and suggest a germline targeting and reverse engineering strategy to initiate and mature the CH235 bnAb lineage.",

To understand how broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can be elicited, we identified, characterized, and tracked five neutralizing Ab lineages targeting the HIV-1-fusion peptide (FP) in vaccinated macaques over time. Genetic and structural analyses revealed two of these lineages to belong to a reproducible class capable of neutralizing up to 59% of 208 diverse viral strains. B cell analysis indicated each of the five lineages to have been initiated and expanded by FP-carrier priming, with envelope (Env)-trimer boosts inducing cross-reactive neutralization. These Abs had binding-energy hotspots focused on FP, whereas several FP-directed Abs induced by immunization with Env trimer-only were less FP-focused and less broadly neutralizing. Priming with a conserved subregion, such as FP, can thus induce Abs with binding-energy hotspots coincident with the target subregion and capable of broad neutralization.",

To obtain a vaccine effective against all four PIV types, we engineered mutations in each of the four PIV fusion (F) glycoproteins to stabilize their metastable prefusion states, as such stabilization had previously enabled the elicitation of high-titer neutralizing antibodies against the related respiratory syncytial virus. A cryoelectron microscopy structure of an engineered PIV3 F prefusion-stabilized trimer, bound to the prefusion-specific antibody PIA174, revealed atomic-level details for how introduced mutations improved stability as well as how a single PIA174 antibody recognized the trimeric apex of prefusion PIV3 F. Nine combinations of six newly identified disulfides and two cavity-filling mutations stabilized the prefusion PIV3 F immunogens and induced 200- to 500-fold higher neutralizing titers in mice than were elicited by PIV3 F in the postfusion conformation. For PIV1, PIV2, and PIV4, we also obtained stabilized prefusion Fs, for which prefusion versus postfusion titers were 2- to 20-fold higher. Elicited murine responses were PIV type-specific, with little cross-neutralization of other PIVs. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), quadrivalent immunization with prefusion-stabilized Fs from PIV1-4 consistently induced potent neutralizing responses against all four PIVs. For PIV3, the average elicited NHP titer from the quadrivalent immunization was more than fivefold higher than any titer observed in a cohort of over 100 human adults, highlighting the ability of a prefusion-stabilized immunogen to elicit especially potent neutralization.",

Recently, Xu et al (2018) elicited cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses in a variety of animal models using immunogens based on the epitope of bnAb VRC34.01. The VRC34.01 antibody, which was elicited by natural human infection, targets the N terminus of the Env fusion peptide, a critical component of the virus entry machinery. Here we precisely characterize the functional epitopes of VRC34.01 and two vaccine-elicited murine antibodies by mapping all single amino-acid mutations to the BG505 Env that affect viral neutralization. While escape from VRC34.01 occurred via mutations in both fusion peptide and distal interacting sites of the Env trimer, escape from the vaccine-elicited antibodies was mediated predominantly by mutations in the fusion peptide. Cryo-electron microscopy of four vaccine-elicited antibodies in complex with Env trimer revealed focused recognition of the fusion peptide and provided a structural basis for development of neutralization breadth. Together, these functional and structural data suggest that the breadth of vaccine-elicited antibodies targeting the fusion peptide can be enhanced by specific interactions with additional portions of Env. Thus, our complete maps of viral escape both delineate pathways of resistance to these fusion peptide-directed antibodies and provide a strategy to improve the breadth or potency of future vaccine-induced antibodies against Env's fusion peptide.",

                  "abstract": "The HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer is a target for vaccine design as well as a conformational machine that facilitates virus entry by transitioning between prefusion-closed, CD4-bound, and coreceptor-bound conformations by transitioning into a postfusion state. Vaccine designers have sought to restrict the conformation of the HIV-1 Env trimer to its prefusion-closed state as this state is recognized by most broadly neutralizing, but not nonneutralizing, antibodies. We previously identified a disulfide bond, I201C-A433C (DS), which stabilizes Env in the vaccine-desired prefusion-closed state. When placed into the context of BG505 SOSIP.664, a soluble Env trimer mimic developed by Sanders, Moore, and colleagues, the engineered DS-SOSIP trimer showed reduced conformational triggering by CD4. Here, we further stabilize DS-SOSIP through a combination of structure-based design and 96-well-based expression and antigenic assessment. From 103 designs, we identified one, named DS-SOSIP.4mut, with four additional mutations at the interface of potentially mobile domains of the prefusion-closed structure. We also determined the crystal structures of DS-SOSIP.4mut at 4.1-Å resolution and of an additional DS-SOSIP.6mut variant at 4.3-Å resolution, and these confirmed the formation of engineered disulfide bonds. Notably, DS-SOSIP.4mut elicited a higher ratio of tier 2 autologous titers versus tier 1 V3-sensitive titers than BG505 SOSIP.664. DS-SOSIP.4mut also showed reduced recognition of CD4 and increased thermostability. The improved antigenicity, thermostability, and immunogenicity of DS-SOSIP.4mut suggest utility as an immunogen or a serologic probe; moreover, the specific four alterations identified here, M154, M300, M302, and L320 (4mut), can also be transferred to other HIV-1 Env trimers of interest to improve their properties.IMPORTANCE One approach to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 is to stabilize the structurally flexible HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer in a conformation that displays predominantly broadly neutralizing epitopes and few to no nonneutralizing epitopes. The prefusion-closed conformation of HIV-1 Env has been identified as one such preferred conformation, and a current leading vaccine candidate is the BG505 DS-SOSIP variant, comprising two disulfides and an Ile-to-Pro mutation of Env from strain BG505. Here, we introduced additional mutations to further stabilize BG505 DS-SOSIP in the vaccine-preferred prefusion-closed conformation. In guinea pigs, our best mutant, DS-SOSIP.4mut, elicited a significantly higher ratio of autologous versus V3-directed neutralizing antibody responses than the SOSIP-stabilized form. We also observed an improvement in thermostability and a reduction in CD4 affinity. With improved antigenicity, stability, and immunogenicity, DS-SOSIP.4mut-stabilized trimers may have utility as HIV-1 immunogens or in other antigen-specific contexts, such as with B-cell probes.",

Although the CD4-binding site has been extensively characterized, the initial receptor interaction has been difficult to study because of major CD4-induced structural rearrangements. Here we used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the initial contact of CD4 with the HIV-1 Env trimer at 6.8-Å resolution. A single CD4 molecule is embraced by a quaternary HIV-1-Env surface formed by coalescence of the previously defined CD4-contact region with a second CD4-binding site (CD4-BS2) in the inner domain of a neighboring gp120 protomer. Disruption of CD4-BS2 destabilized CD4-trimer interaction and abrogated HIV-1 infectivity by preventing the acquisition of coreceptor-binding competence. A corresponding reduction in HIV-1 infectivity occurred after the mutation of CD4 residues that interact with CD4-BS2. Our results document the critical role of quaternary interactions in the initial HIV-Env-receptor contact, with implications for treatment and vaccine design.",

Here, we define with longitudinal sampling from time-of-infection the development of a VH1-46-derived antibody lineage that matured to neutralize 90% of HIV-1 isolates. Structures of lineage antibodies CH235 (week 41 from time-of-infection, 18% breadth), CH235.9 (week 152, 77%), and CH235.12 (week 323, 90%) demonstrated the maturing epitope to focus on the conformationally invariant portion of the CD4bs. Similarities between CH235 lineage and five unrelated CD4bs lineages in epitope focusing, length-of-time to develop breadth, and extraordinary level of somatic hypermutation suggested commonalities in maturation among all CD4bs antibodies. Fortunately, the required CH235-lineage hypermutation appeared substantially guided by the intrinsic mutability of the VH1-46 gene, which closely resembled VH1-2. We integrated our CH235-lineage findings with a second broadly neutralizing lineage and HIV-1 co-evolution to suggest a vaccination strategy for inducing both lineages.",

Consequently, an understanding of the molecular basis for Env epitopes that constitute effective ADCC targets is of fundamental interest for humoral anti-HIV-1 immunity and for HIV-1 vaccine design. A substantial portion of FcR effector function of potentially protective anti-HIV-1 antibodies is directed toward nonneutralizing, transitional, CD4-inducible (CD4i) epitopes associated with the gp41-reactive region of gp120 (cluster A epitopes). Our previous studies defined the A32-like epitope within the cluster A region and mapped it to the highly conserved and mobile layers 1 and 2 of the gp120 inner domain within the C1-C2 regions of gp120. Here, we elucidate additional cluster A epitope structures, including an A32-like epitope, recognized by human monoclonal antibody (MAb) N60-i3, and a hybrid A32-C11-like epitope, recognized by rhesus macaque MAb JR4. These studies define for the first time a hybrid A32-C11-like epitope and map it to elements of both the A32-like subregion and the seven-layered β-sheet of the gp41-interactive region of gp120. These studies provide additional evidence that effective antibody-dependent effector function in the cluster A region depends on precise epitope targeting--a combination of epitope footprint and mode of antibody attachment. All together these findings help further an understanding of how cluster A epitopes are targeted by humoral responses. IMPORTANCE: HIV/AIDS has claimed the lives of over 30 million people. Although antiretroviral drugs can control viral replication, no vaccine has yet been developed to prevent the spread of the disease. Studies of natural HIV-1 infection, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)- or simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs), and HIV-1-infected humanized mouse models, passive transfer studies in infants born to HIV-infected mothers, and the RV144 clinical trial have linked FcR-mediated effector functions of anti-HIV-1 antibodies with postinfection control of viremia and/or blocking viral acquisition. With this report we provide additional definition of the molecular determinants for Env antigen engagement which lead to effective antibody-dependent effector function directed to the nonneutralizing CD4-dependent epitopes in the gp41-reactive region of gp120. These findings have important implications for the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine.",

Here we present the structure of the ligand-free HIV-1-Env trimer, fix its conformation and determine its receptor interactions. Epitope analyses revealed trimeric ligand-free Env to be structurally compatible with broadly neutralizing antibodies but not poorly neutralizing ones. We coupled these compatibility considerations with binding antigenicity to engineer conformationally fixed Envs, including a 201C 433C (DS) variant specifically recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. DS-Env retained nanomolar affinity for the CD4 receptor, with which it formed an asymmetric intermediate: a closed trimer bound by a single CD4 without the typical antigenic hallmarks of CD4 induction. Antigenicity-guided structural design can thus be used both to delineate mechanism and to fix conformation, with DS-Env trimers in virus-like-particle and soluble formats providing a new generation of vaccine antigens.",

To understand how antibodies achieve such neutralization, we isolated CD4-binding-site (CD4bs) antibodies and analyzed 16 co-crystal structures -8 determined here- of CD4bs antibodies from 14 donors. The 16 antibodies segregated by recognition mode and developmental ontogeny into two types: CDR H3-dominated and VH-gene-restricted. Both could achieve greater than 80% neutralization breadth, and both could develop in the same donor. Although paratope chemistries differed, all 16 gp120-CD4bs antibody complexes showed geometric similarity, with antibody-neutralization breadth correlating with antibody-angle of approach relative to the most effective antibody of each type. The repertoire for effective recognition of the CD4 supersite thus comprises antibodies with distinct paratopes arrayed about two optimal geometric orientations, one achieved by CDR H3 ontogenies and the other achieved by VH-gene-restricted ontogenies.",

                  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The HIV-1 gp120 envelope (Env) glycoprotein mediates attachment of virus to human target cells that display requisite receptors, CD4 and co-receptor, generally CCR5. Despite high-affinity interactions with host receptors and proof-of-principle by the drug maraviroc that interference with CCR5 provides therapeutic benefit, no licensed drug currently targets gp120. AREAS COVERED: An overview of the role of gp120 in HIV-1 entry and of sites of potential gp120 vulnerability to therapeutic inhibition is presented. Viral defenses that protect these sites and turn gp120 into a moving labyrinth are discussed together with strategies for circumventing these defenses to allow therapeutic targeting of gp120 sites of vulnerability. EXPERT OPINION: The gp120 envelope glycoprotein interacts with host proteins through multiple interfaces and has conserved structural features at these interaction sites. In spite of this, targeting gp120 for therapeutic purposes is challenging. Env mechanisms that have evolved to evade the humoral immune response also shield it from potential therapeutics. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made in understanding HIV-1 gp120 structure and its interactions with host receptors, and in developing therapeutic leads that potently neutralize diverse HIV-1 strains. Synergies between advances in understanding, needs for therapeutics against novel viral targets and characteristics of breadth and potency for a number of gp120-targetting lead molecules bodes well for gp120 as a HIV-1 therapeutic target.",

Here we show that when macaques were inoculated with either the T cell tropic SIVmac239 or the macrophage tropic SIVmac316 carrying a Vpx point mutation that abrogates the recruitment of DCAF1 and the ensuing degradation of endogenous SAMHD1 in cultured CD4+ T cells, virus acquisition, progeny virion production in memory CD4+ T cells during acute infection, and the maintenance of set-point viremia were greatly attenuated. Revertant viruses emerging in two animals exhibited an augmented replication phenotype in memory CD4+ T lymphocytes both in vitro and in vivo, which was associated with reduced levels of endogenous SAMHD1. These results indicate that a critical role of Vpx in vivo is to promote the degradation of SAMHD1 in memory CD4+ T lymphocytes, thereby generating high levels of plasma viremia and the induction of immunodeficiency.",

Here, we examined whether HIV-1-specific bNabs are capable of cross-neutralizing distantly related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting central (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) (SIVcpzPtt) and eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) (SIVcpzPts) chimpanzees (n = 11) as well as western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) (SIVgor) (n = 1). We found that bNabs directed against the CD4 binding site (n = 10), peptidoglycans at the base of variable loop 3 (V3) (n = 5), and epitopes at the interface of surface (gp120) and membrane-bound (gp41) envelope glycoproteins (n = 5) failed to neutralize SIVcpz and SIVgor strains. In addition, apex V2-directed bNabs (n = 3) as well as llama-derived (heavy chain only) antibodies (n = 6) recognizing both the CD4 binding site and gp41 epitopes were either completely inactive or neutralized only a fraction of SIVcpzPtt strains. In contrast, one antibody targeting the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 (10E8), functional CD4 and CCR5 receptor mimetics (eCD4-Ig, eCD4-Ig(mim2), CD4-218.3-E51, and CD4-218.3-E51-mim2), as well as mono- and bispecific anti-human CD4 (iMab and LM52) and CCR5 (PRO140, PRO140-10E8) receptor antibodies neutralized >90% of SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with low-nanomolar (0.13 to 8.4 nM) potency. Importantly, the latter antibodies blocked virus entry not only in TZM-bl cells but also in Cf2Th cells expressing chimpanzee CD4 and CCR5 and neutralized SIVcpz in chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) ranging from 3.6 to 40.5 nM. These findings provide new insight into the protective capacity of anti-HIV-1 bNabs and identify candidates for further development to combat SIVcpz infection. IMPORTANCE: SIVcpz is widespread in wild-living chimpanzees and can cause AIDS-like immunopathology and clinical disease. HIV-1 infection of humans can be controlled by antiretroviral therapy; however, treatment of wild-living African apes with current drug regimens is not feasible. Nonetheless, it may be possible to curb the spread of SIVcpz in select ape communities using vectored immunoprophylaxis and/or therapy. Here, we show that antibodies and antibody-like inhibitors developed to combat HIV-1 infection in humans are capable of neutralizing genetically diverse SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with considerable breadth and potency, including in primary chimpanzee CD4(+) T cells. These reagents provide an important first step toward translating intervention strategies currently developed to treat and prevent AIDS in humans to SIV-infected apes.",

A32-like epitopes are highly immunogenic, as infected or vaccinated individuals frequently produce antibodies specific for these determinants. Antibody titers, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against these epitopes, however, do not consistently correlate with protection. Here, we report crystal structures of CD4-stabilized gp120 cores complexed with the Fab fragments of two nonneutralizing, A32-like monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), N5-i5 and 2.2c, that compete for antigen binding and have similar antigen-binding affinities yet exhibit a 75-fold difference in ADCC potency. We find that these MAbs recognize overlapping epitopes formed by mobile layers 1 and 2 of the gp120 inner domain, including the C1 and C2 regions, but bind gp120 at different angles via juxtaposed VH and VL contact surfaces. A comparison of structural and immunological data further showed that antibody orientation on bound antigen and the capacity to form multivalent antigen-antibody complexes on target cells were key determinants of ADCC potency, with the latter process having the greater impact. These studies provide atomic-level definition of A32-like epitopes implicated as targets of protective antibodies in RV144. Moreover, these studies establish that epitope structure and mode of antibody binding can dramatically affect the potency of Fc-mediated effector function against HIV-1. These results provide key insights for understanding, refining, and improving the outcome of HIV vaccine trials, in which relevant immune responses are facilitated by A32-like elicited responses. IMPORTANCE: HIV-1 Env is a primary target for antibodies elicited during infection. Although a small number of infected individuals elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies, the bulk of the humoral response consists of antibodies that do not neutralize or do so with limited breadth but may effect protection through Fc receptor-dependent processes, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Understanding these nonneutralizing responses is an important aspect of elucidating the complete spectrum of immune response against HIV-1 infection. With this report, we provide the first atomic-level definition of nonneutralizing CD4-induced epitopes in the N-terminal region of the HIV-1 gp120 (A32-like epitopes). Further, our studies point to the dominant role of precise epitope targeting and mode of antibody attachment in ADCC responses even when largely overlapping epitopes are involved.

As the sole viral antigen on the HIV-1 virion surface, Env is both the target of neutralizing antibodies and a focus of vaccine efforts. Here we report the structure at 3.5 Å resolution for an HIV-1 Env trimer captured in a mature closed state by antibodies PGT122 and 35O22. This structure reveals the pre-fusion conformation of gp41, indicates rearrangements needed for fusion activation, and defines parameters of immune evasion and immune recognition. Pre-fusion gp41 encircles amino- and carboxy-terminal strands of gp120 with four helices that form a membrane-proximal collar, fastened by insertion of a fusion peptide-proximal methionine into a gp41-tryptophan clasp. Spike rearrangements required for entry involve opening the clasp and expelling the termini. N-linked glycosylation and sequence-variable regions cover the pre-fusion closed spike; we used chronic cohorts to map the prevalence and location of effective HIV-1-neutralizing responses, which were distinguished by their recognition of N-linked glycan and tolerance for epitope-sequence variation.",

Ideally, epitope residues are determined in the context of the atomic-level structure of the antibody-antigen complex, though structure determination may in many cases be impractical. Here we describe an efficient computational method to predict antibody-specific HIV-1 envelope (Env) epitopes at the residue level, based on neutralization panels of diverse viral strains. The method primarily utilizes neutralization potency data over a set of diverse viral strains representing the antigen, and enhanced accuracy could be achieved by incorporating information from the unbound structure of the antigen. The method was evaluated on 19 HIV-1 Env antibodies with neutralization panels comprising 181 diverse viral strains and with available antibody-antigen complex structures. Prediction accuracy was shown to improve significantly over random selection, with an average of greater-than-8-fold enrichment of true positives at the 0.05 false-positive rate level. The method was used to prospectively predict epitope residues for two HIV-1 antibodies, 8ANC131 and 8ANC195, for which we experimentally validated the predictions. The method is inherently applicable to antigens that exhibit sequence diversity, and its accuracy was found to correlate inversely with sequence conservation of the epitope. Together the results show how knowledge inherent to a neutralization panel and unbound antigen structure can be utilized for residue-level prediction of antibody epitopes.",

While inaccessible to most human antibodies, the coreceptor site has been shown to be accessed by antibody fragments. In this study, we used X-ray crystallography, surface plasmon resonance, and pseudovirus neutralization to characterize the gp120-envelope glycoprotein recognition and HIV-1 neutralization of a heavy chain-only llama antibody, named JM4. We describe full-length IgG2b and IgG3 versions of JM4 that target the coreceptor-binding site and potently neutralize over 95% of circulating HIV-1 isolates. Contrary to established trends that show improved access to the coreceptor-binding region by smaller antibody fragments, the single-domain (VHH) version of JM4 neutralized less well than the full-length IgG2b version of JM4. The crystal structure at 2.1-Å resolution of VHH JM4 bound to HIV-1 YU2 gp120 stabilized in the CD4-bound state by the CD4-mimetic miniprotein, M48U1, revealed a JM4 epitope that combined regions of coreceptor recognition (including the gp120 bridging sheet, V3 loop, and β19 strand) with gp120 structural elements involved in recognition of CD4 such as the CD4-binding loop. The structure of JM4 with gp120 thus defines a novel CD4-induced site of vulnerability involving elements of both coreceptor- and CD4-binding sites. The potently neutralizing JM4 IgG2b antibody that targets this newly defined site of vulnerability adds to the expanding repertoire of broadly neutralizing antibodies that effectively neutralize HIV-1 and thereby potentially provides a new template for vaccine development and target for HIV-1 therapy.",

Here we determine the ontogeny of the VRC01 class by crystallography and next-generation sequencing. Despite antibody-sequence differences exceeding 50%, antibody-gp120 cocrystal structures reveal VRC01-class recognition to be remarkably similar. B cell transcripts indicate that VRC01-class antibodies require few specific genetic elements, suggesting that naive-B cells with VRC01-class features are generated regularly by recombination. Virtually all of these fail to mature, however, with only a few-likely one-ancestor B cell expanding to form a VRC01-class lineage in each donor.

It contained a methylcyclohexyl derivative of 4-aminophenylalanine, and its cocrystal structure with gp120 revealed the cyclohexane ring buried within the gp120 hydrophobic core but able to assume multiple orientations in the binding pocket, and the aniline nitrogen potentially providing a focus for further improvement.

                  "abstract": "To initiate HIV entry, the HIV envelope protein gp120 must engage its primary receptor CD4 and a coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4. In the absence of a high resolution structure of a gp120-coreceptor complex, biochemical studies of CCR5 have revealed the importance of its N terminus and second extracellular loop (ECL2) in binding gp120 and mediating viral entry. Using a panel of synthetic CCR5 ECL2-derived peptides, we show that the C-terminal portion of ECL2 (2C, comprising amino acids Cys-178 to Lys-191) inhibit HIV-1 entry of both CCR5- and CXCR4-using isolates at low micromolar concentrations. In functional viral assays, these peptides inhibited HIV-1 entry in a CD4-independent manner. Neutralization assays designed to measure the effects of CCR5 ECL2 peptides when combined with either with the small molecule CD4 mimetic NBD-556, soluble CD4, or the CCR5 N terminus showed additive inhibition for each, indicating that ECL2 binds gp120 at a site distinct from that of N terminus and acts independently of CD4. Using saturation transfer difference NMR, we determined the region of CCR5 ECL2 used for binding gp120, showed that it can bind to gp120 from both R5 and X4 isolates, and demonstrated that the peptide interacts with a CD4-gp120 complex in a similar manner as to gp120 alone. As the CCR5 N terminus-gp120 interactions are dependent on CD4 activation, our data suggest that gp120 has separate binding sites for the CCR5 N terminus and ECL2, the ECL2 binding site is present prior to CD4 engagement, and it is conserved across CCR5- and CXCR4-using strains. These peptides may serve as a starting point for the design of inhibitors with broad spectrum anti-HIV activity.",

After engaging the CD4 receptor at the cell surface, the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein binds to the CCR5 co-receptor via an interaction that requires two tyrosine sulfates, at positions 10 and 14 in the CCR5-N terminus. Building on previous structure determinations of this interaction, here we report the targeting of these tyrosine sulfate binding sites for drug design through in silico screening of small molecule libraries, identification of lead compounds, and characterization of biological activity. A class of tyrosine sulfate-mimicking small molecules containing a \"phenyl sulfonate-linker-aromatic\" motif was identified that specifically inhibited binding of gp120 to the CCR5-N terminus as well as to sulfated antibodies that recognize the co-receptor binding region on gp120. The most potent of these compounds bound gp120 with low micromolar affinity and its CD4-induced conformation with K(D)'s as tight as ∼50 nM. Neutralization experiments suggested the targeted site to be conformationally inaccessible prior to CD4 engagement. Primary HIV-1 isolates were weakly neutralized, preincubation with soluble CD4 enhanced neutralization, and engineered isolates with increased dependence on the N terminus of CCR5 or with reduced conformational barriers were neutralized with IC(50) values as low as ∼1 μM. These results reveal the potential of targeting the tyrosine sulfate interactions of HIV-1 and provide insight into how mechanistic barriers, evolved by HIV-1 to evade antibody recognition, also restrict small-molecule-mediated neutralization.",

Among quantum emitters, diamond defect centers, with their atomic-like characteristics, have drawn intense interest for quantum applications. However, the spontaneous emission lifetime of single photons from diamond defects has been limited to several hundred picoseconds, partly due to challenges in realizing cavities in diamond with sufficiently small mode volumes. Here, we sandwich an only 10 nm diamond membrane with implanted negatively charged silicon vacancy centers (SiV<sup>-</sup>) between a gold mirror and arrays of nanodisks, resulting in ultrafast single-photon sources with lifetimes as short as 5.5 ps. This corresponds to an improvement in the radiative spontaneous emission rate of over 700-fold, also termed the Purcell factor, and is the result of a greatly enhanced local density of states in the ultrasmall mode-volume cavities. Furthermore, the cavity-coupled single SiV<sup>-</sup> centers exhibit a 4800-fold photoluminescence enhancement with a single-photon generation rate of up to 361 Mcps at room temperature. These results could refine the engineering of diamond defect centers and position other solid-state platforms as strong quantum-information contenders when coupled to ultrasmall mode-volume cavities, thus illustrating the potential for large-scale, artificially tailored single-photon sources.",

This route circumvents the need for high‑Q cavities or intricate nanolithography, and the sample gradient offers a visualization of broadband resonances and anti‑resonances across the visible to near‑infrared spectrum. These findings offer an alternative method for controlling effective brightness enhancement or suppression of diamond color centers-based quantum photonics.

The interplay between cavity, implantation depth, and ultrathin diamond membranes provides insights into generating ultrafast, bright SiV emission for next-generation diamond devices.",

Yet, associations between intraoperative anaesthetic-dose-adjusted alpha power and delirium or delirium risk factors have yet to be quantified. METHODS: We examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related biomarkers, cognitive scores, EEG recordings, and delirium data from 82 noncardiac, non-neurologic surgical patients ≥60 yr in age. Based on prior work, each participant's intraoperative frontoparietal EEG alpha power was anaesthetic dose-adjusted by dividing it by (2.5 minus the age-adjusted end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration), and then analysed for its association with POD and delirium risk factors, preoperative CSF AD-related biomarkers, and preoperative cognition. RESULTS: Lower anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was associated with increased odds of POD (odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.44 [1.09, 1.89], P=0.009) and moderate-to-severe delirium (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.44 [1.04, 2.00], P=0.030). Anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was not associated with pathologic concentrations of CSF pTau-181, Aβ1-42, or pTau-181/Aβ1-42 (P>0.05). In multivariable cognitive models, anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was associated with preoperative timed processing speed/executive function performance (β [95% CI]: 0.27 [0.06, 0.49], P=0.014), but not with untimed attention/memory performance (β [95% CI]: 0.12 [-0.13, 0.37], P=0.349). CONCLUSIONS: Lower intraoperative anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was associated with delirium and delirium-predisposing factors (impaired preoperative processing speed/executive function in timed attention tasks). Larger studies are warranted to confirm these associations after further adjustment for covariates.",

Here, we studied whether the severity of untreated obstructive sleep apnea is associated with the severity of postoperative neurocognitive disorder. METHODS: In this single-center prospective cohort study, older noncardiac surgery patients aged 60 years and above underwent preoperative home sleep apnea testing, and pre- and postoperative delirium assessments and cognitive testing. Sleep apnea severity was determined using the measured respiratory event index (REI). Global cognitive change from before to 6 weeks (and 1 year) after surgery was used to measure postoperative neurocognitive disorder severity. Postoperative changes in individual cognitive domain performance along with subjective cognitive complaints and/or deficits in instrumental activities of daily living were used to measure postoperative neurocognitive disorder incidence. RESULTS: Of 96 subjects who completed home sleep apnea testing, 58 tested positive for sleep apnea. In univariable analyses, sleep apnea severity was not associated with increased postoperative neurocognitive disorder severity at 6 weeks (global cognitive change ; [95% confidence interval [CI], -0.02 to 0.03]; P = .79) or 1-year after surgery (; [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.03]; P = .70). Adjusting for age, sex, baseline cognition, and surgery duration, sleep apnea severity remained not associated with increased postoperative neurocognitive disorder severity at 6 weeks (; [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.04]; P = .40) or 1-year after surgery (; [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.04]; P = .55). In a multivariable analysis, sleep apnea severity was not associated with postoperative neurocognitive disorder (either mild or major) incidence at 6 weeks (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89, [95% CI, 0.59-1.14]; P = .45) or 1-year postoperatively (OR = 1.01, [95% CI, 0.81-1.24]; P = .90). Sleep apnea severity was also not associated with postoperative delirium in univariable analyses (delirium incidence OR = 0.88, [95% CI, 0.59-1.10]; P = .37; delirium severity ; [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.03]; P = .79) or in multivariable analyses (delirium incidence OR = 1.07, [95% CI, 0.81-1.38]; P = .74; delirium severity OR = 0.95, [95% CI, 0.81-1.10]; P = .48).

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is the most common complication following surgery among older adults, and has been consistently associated with increased mortality and morbidity, cognitive decline, and loss of independence, as well as markedly increased health-care costs. Electroencephalography (EEG) spectral slowing has frequently been observed during episodes of delirium, whereas intraoperative frontal alpha power is associated with postoperative delirium. We sought to identify preoperative predictors that could identify individuals at high risk for postoperative delirium, which could guide clinical decision-making and enable targeted interventions to potentially decrease delirium incidence and postoperative delirium-related complications. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we used machine learning to evaluate whether baseline (preoperative) cognitive function and resting-state EEG could be used to identify patients at risk for postoperative delirium. Preoperative resting-state EEGs and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment were collected from 85 patients (age = 73 ± 6.4 years, 12 cases of delirium) undergoing elective surgery. The model with the highest f1-score was subsequently validated in an independent, prospective cohort of 51 older adults (age = 68 ± 5.2 years, 6 cases of delirium) undergoing elective surgery. RESULTS: Occipital alpha powers have higher f1-score than frontal alpha powers and EEG spectral slowing in the training cohort. Occipital alpha powers were able to predict postoperative delirium with AUC, specificity and accuracy all >90%, and sensitivity >80%, in the validation cohort. Notably, models incorporating transformed alpha powers and cognitive scores outperformed models incorporating occipital alpha powers alone or cognitive scores alone. CONCLUSIONS: While requiring prospective validation in larger cohorts, these results suggest that strong prediction of postoperative delirium may be feasible in clinical settings using simple and widely available clinical tools. Additionally, our results suggested that the thalamocortical circuit exhibits different EEG patterns under different stressors, with occipital alpha powers potentially reflecting baseline vulnerabilities.",

                  "abstract": "Nearly all geriatric surgical complications are studied in the context of a single organ system, e.g., cardiac complications and the heart; delirium and the brain; infections and the immune system. Yet, we know that advanced age, physiological stress, and infection all increase sympathetic and decrease parasympathetic nervous system function. Parasympathetic function is mediated through the vagus nerve, which connects the heart, brain, and immune system to form, what we have termed, the brain-heart-immune axis. We hypothesize that this brain-heart-immune axis plays a critical role in surgical recovery among older adults. In particular, we hypothesize that the brain-heart-immune axis plays a critical role in the most common surgical complication among older adults: postoperative delirium. Further, we present heart rate variability as a measure that may eventually become a multi-system vital sign evaluating brain-heart-immune axis function. Finally, we suggest the brain-heart-immune axis as a potential interventional target for bio-electronic neuro-immune modulation to enhance resilient surgical recovery among older adults.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the eyes-closed, awake condition, EEG oscillatory power in the alpha band (7-13 Hz) dominates human spectral activity. With eyes open, however, EEG alpha power substantially decreases. Less alpha attenuation with eyes opening has been associated with inattention; thus, we analysed whether reduced preoperative alpha attenuation with eyes opening is associated with postoperative inattention, a delirium-defining feature. METHODS: Preoperative awake 32-channel EEG was recorded with eyes open and eyes closed in 71 non-neurological, noncardiac surgery patients aged ≥ 60 years. Inattention and other delirium features were assessed before surgery and twice daily after surgery until discharge. Eyes-opening EEG alpha-attenuation magnitude was analysed for associations with postoperative inattention, primarily, and with delirium severity, secondarily, using multivariate age- and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE)-adjusted logistic and proportional-odds regression analyses. RESULTS: Preoperative alpha attenuation with eyes opening was inversely associated with postoperative inattention (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57, 0.94; P=0.038). Sensitivity analyses showed an inverse relationship between alpha-attenuation magnitude and inattention chronicity, defined as 'never', 'newly', or 'chronically' inattentive (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.93; P=0.019). In addition, preoperative alpha-attenuation magnitude was inversely associated with postoperative delirium severity (OR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.95; P=0.040), predominantly as a result of the inattention feature. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative awake, resting, EEG alpha attenuation with eyes opening might represent a neural biomarker for risk of postoperative attentional impairment. Further, eyes-opening alpha attenuation could provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying postoperative inattention risk.",

METHODS: This was a nested randomised controlled trial within a prospective cohort study; patients age ≥60 yr undergoing noncardiac/non-neurological surgery were randomised to isoflurane or propofol for anaesthetic maintenance. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected via lumbar puncture before, 24 h, and 6 weeks after surgery. Cognitive testing was performed before and 6 weeks after surgery. Nonparametric methods and linear regression were used to evaluate CSF biomarkers and cognitive function, respectively. RESULTS: There were 107 subjects (54 randomised to isoflurane and 53 to propofol) who completed the 6-week follow-up and were included in the analysis. There was no significant effect of anaesthetic treatment group, time, or group-by-time interaction for CSF amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, or phospho-tau181p levels, or on the tau/Aβ or p-tau181p/Aβ ratios (all P>0.05 after Bonferroni correction). In multivariable-adjusted intention-to-treat analyses, there were no significant differences between the isoflurane and propofol groups in 6-week postoperative change in overall cognition (mean difference [95% confidence interval]: 0.01 [-0.12 to 0.13]; P=0.89) or individual cognitive domains (P>0.05 for each). Results remained consistent across as-treated and per-protocol analyses.

                  "abstract": "The most common complication in older surgical patients is postoperative delirium (POD). POD is associated with preoperative cognitive impairment and longer durations of intraoperative burst suppression (BSup) - electroencephalography (EEG) with repeated periods of suppression (very low-voltage brain activity). However, BSup has modest sensitivity for predicting POD. We hypothesized that a brain state of lowered EEG power immediately precedes BSup, which we have termed \"pre-burst suppression\" (preBSup). Further, we hypothesized that even patients without BSup experience these preBSup transient reductions in EEG power, and that preBSup (like BSup) would be associated with preoperative cognitive function and delirium risk. Data included 83 32-channel intraoperative EEG recordings of the first hour of surgery from 2 prospective cohort studies of patients ≥age 60 scheduled for ≥2-h non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgery under general anesthesia (maintained with a potent inhaled anesthetic or a propofol infusion). Among patients with BSup, we defined preBSup as the difference in 3-35 Hz power (dB) during the 1-s preceding BSup relative to the average 3-35 Hz power of their intraoperative EEG recording. We then recorded the percentage of time that each patient spent in preBSup, including those without BSup. Next, we characterized the association between percentage of time in preBSup and (1) percentage of time in BSup, (2) preoperative cognitive function, and (3) POD incidence. The percentage of time in preBSup and BSup were correlated (Spearman's ρ [95% CI]: 0.52 [0.34, 0.66], p < 0.001). The percentage of time in BSup, preBSup, or their combination were each inversely associated with preoperative cognitive function (β [95% CI]: -0.10 [-0.19, -0.01], p = 0.024; -0.04 [-0.06, -0.01], p = 0.009; -0.04 [-0.06, -0.01], p = 0.003, respectively). Consistent with prior literature, BSup was significantly associated with POD (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.34 [1.01, 1.78], p = 0.043), though this association did not hold for preBSup (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.04 [0.95, 1.14], p = 0.421). While all patients had ≥1 preBSup instance, only 20.5% of patients had ≥1 BSup instance. These exploratory findings suggest that future studies are warranted to further study the extent to which preBSup, even in the absence of BSup, can identify patients with impaired preoperative cognition and/or POD risk.",

Matched plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the \"Investigating Neuroinflammation Underlying Postoperative Brain Connectivity Changes, Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction, Delirium in Older Adults\" (INTUIT; NCT03273335) study were compared to murine endpoints. Delirium-like behavior was evaluated in aged mice using the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Test (5-CSRTT). Using a well established orthopedic surgical model in the FosTRAP reporter mouse we detected neuronal changes in the prefrontal cortex, an area implicated in attention, but notably not in the hippocampus. In aged mice, plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels increased after orthopedic surgery, but hippocampal YKL-40 expression was decreased. Given the growing evidence for a YKL-40 role in delirium and other neurodegenerative conditions, we assayed human plasma and CSF samples. Plasma YKL-40 levels were similarly increased after surgery, with a trend toward a greater postoperative plasma YKL-40 increase in patients with delirium. However, YKL-40 levels in CSF decreased following surgery, which paralleled the findings in the mouse brain. Finally, we confirmed changes in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as early as 9 h after surgery in mice, which warrants more detailed and acute evaluations of BBB integrity following surgery in humans. Together, these results provide a nuanced understanding of neuroimmune interactions underlying postoperative delirium in mice and humans, and highlight translational biomarkers to test potential cellular targets and mechanisms.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Numerous investigators have theorized that postoperative changes in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology may underlie postoperative neurocognitive disorders. Thus, we determined the relationship between postoperative changes in cognition and cerebrospinal (CSF) tau, p-tau-181p, or Aβ levels after non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgery in older adults. METHODS: Participants underwent cognitive testing before and 6 weeks after surgery, and lumbar punctures before, 24 h after, and 6 weeks after surgery. Cognitive scores were combined via factor analysis into an overall cognitive index. In total, 110 patients returned for 6-week postoperative testing and were included in the analysis. RESULTS: There was no significant change from before to 24 h or 6 weeks following surgery in CSF tau (median [median absolute deviation] change before to 24 h: 0.00 [4.36] pg/mL, p = 0.853; change before to 6 weeks: -1.21 [3.98] pg/mL, p = 0.827). There were also no significant changes in CSF p-tau-181p or Aβ over this period. There was no change in cognitive index (mean [95% CI] 0.040 [-0.018, 0.098], p = 0.175) from before to 6 weeks after surgery, although there were postoperative declines in verbal memory (-0.346 [-0.523, -0.170], p = 0.003) and improvements in executive function (0.394, [0.310, 0.479], p < 0.001). There were no significant correlations between preoperative to 6-week postoperative changes in cognition and CSF tau, p-tau-181p, or Aβ42 changes over this interval (p > 0.05 for each). INTERPRETATION: Neurocognitive changes after non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgery in the majority of cognitively healthy, community-dwelling older adults are unlikely to be related to postoperative changes in AD neuropathology (as assessed by CSF Aβ, tau or p-tau-181p levels or the p-tau-181p/Aβ or tau/Aβ ratios).

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a syndrome of cognitive deficits occurring 1-12 months after surgery primarily in older patients, is associated with poor postoperative outcomes. POCD is hypothesized to result from neuroinflammation; however, the pathways involved remain unclear. Unbiased proteomic analyses have been used to identify neuroinflammatory pathways in multiple neurologic diseases and syndromes but have not yet been applied to POCD. OBJECTIVE: To utilize unbiased mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify potential neuroinflammatory pathways underlying POCD. METHODS: Unbiased LC-MS/MS proteomics was performed on immunodepleted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained before, 24 hours after, and 6 weeks after major non-cardiac surgery in older adults who did (n = 8) or did not develop POCD (n = 6). Linear mixed models were used to select peptides and proteins with intensity differences for pathway analysis. RESULTS: Mass spectrometry quantified 8,258 peptides from 1,222 proteins in > 50%of patient samples at all three time points. Twelve peptides from 11 proteins showed differences in expression over time between patients with versus withoutPOCD (q < 0.05), including proteins previously implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathophysiology. Additionally, 283 peptides from 182 proteins were identified with trend-level differences (q < 0.25) in expression over time between these groups. Among these, pathway analysis revealed that 50 were from 17 proteins mapping to complement and coagulation pathways (q = 2.44*10-13). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the feasibility of performing unbiased mass spectrometry on perioperative CSF samples to identify pathways associated with POCD. Additionally, they provide hypothesis-generating evidence for CSF complement and coagulation pathway changes in patients with POCD.",

The complexity of this behavior can be quantified using multi-scale entropy (MSE). High physiologic complexity denotes health, and a loss of complexity can predict adverse outcomes. Since postoperative delirium is particularly hard to predict, we investigated whether the complexity of preoperative and intraoperative frontal EEG signals could predict postoperative delirium and its endophenotype, inattention. To calculate MSE, the sample entropy of EEG recordings was computed at different time scales, then plotted against scale; complexity is the total area under the curve. MSE of frontal EEG recordings was computed in 50 patients ≥ age 60 before and during surgery. Average MSE was higher intra-operatively than pre-operatively (p = 0.0003). However, intraoperative EEG MSE was lower than preoperative MSE at smaller scales, but higher at larger scales (interaction p < 0.001), creating a crossover point where, by definition, preoperative, and intraoperative MSE curves met. Overall, EEG complexity was not associated with delirium or attention. In 42/50 patients with single crossover points, the scale at which the intraoperative and preoperative entropy curves crossed showed an inverse relationship with delirium-severity score change (Spearman ρ = -0.31, p = 0.054). Thus, average EEG complexity increases intra-operatively in older adults, but is scale dependent. The scale at which preoperative and intraoperative complexity is equal (i.e., the crossover point) may predict delirium. Future studies should assess whether the crossover point represents changes in neural control mechanisms that predispose patients to postoperative delirium.",

Further, this protocol describes techniques for inserting and removing the large volume illuminator. Both superficial and deep structures may be illuminated. This large volume illuminator does not need to be physically coupled to an electrode, and because the illuminator is made of plastic, not glass, it will simply bend in circumstances when traditional optical fibers would shatter.

Here, we present a suite of technologies to use optogenetics effectively in primates and apply these tools to a classic question in oculomotor control. First, we measured light absorption and heat propagation in vivo, optimized the conditions for using the red-light-shifted halorhodopsin Jaws in primates, and developed a large-volume illuminator to maximize light delivery with minimal heating and tissue displacement. Together, these advances allowed for nearly universal neuronal inactivation across more than 10 mm3 of the cortex. Using these tools, we demonstrated large behavioral changes (i.e., up to several fold increases in error rate) with relatively low light power densities (≤100 mW/mm2) in the frontal eye field (FEF). Pharmacological inactivation studies have shown that the FEF is critical for executing saccades to remembered locations. FEF neurons increase their firing rate during the three epochs of the memory-guided saccade task: visual stimulus presentation, the delay interval, and motor preparation. It is unclear from earlier work, however, whether FEF activity during each epoch is necessary for memory-guided saccade execution. By harnessing the temporal specificity of optogenetics, we found that FEF contributes to memory-guided eye movements during every epoch of the memory-guided saccade task (the visual, delay, and motor periods).",

Citizen science projects have been shown to enable large-scale data collection, increase scientific literacy, and monitor environmental quality. However, few studies have examined the individual-level motivations and impacts of citizen science participation. We employ an exploratory multi-method approach (on-line surveys, a focus-group session, informal interviews, and descriptive statements) to evaluate the experiences of citizen scientists volunteering with two conservation organizations based in Bangalore, India. Our findings suggest that citizen science may contribute to increased environmental awareness among the general public. In particular, we identify a three-step process whereby highly motivated individuals, or environmental opinion leaders, seek out citizen science opportunities due to an interest in one or more environmental issues; gain expertise through citizen science participation; and diffuse acquired skills and knowledge to peers through social networks, education of other non-scientist Indian citizens, and/or changes in career or education trajectories. As a result, citizen scientists in India promote environmental principles through an active environmental advocacy network.",

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been the standard of care for thromboprophylaxis in this population. However, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly being used as alternatives. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of DOACs versus LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in orthopedic surgery. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until April 2020, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DOACs with LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in orthopedic surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-five RCTs met inclusion criteria, including 40,438 patients, with a mean age of 68 years and 50% were males. Compared to LMWH, DOACs were associated with a significant reduction of major VTE; defined as the composite events of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and VTE-related mortality (RR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.20-0.53; P<0.01), and total DVT (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.48-0.73; P<0.01), but not PE (RR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.49-1.34; P=0.42). There was no statistically significant difference between both groups on the incidence of major bleeding (RR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.77-1.27; P=0.92), clinically relevant non-major bleeding (RR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.92-1.17; P=0.52), all-cause mortality (RR 1.06; 95% CI: 0.64-1.76; P=0.83), VTE-related mortality (RR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.40-1.74; P=0.64) and bleeding-related mortality (RR 1.24; 95% CI: 0.30-5.18; P=0.77). CONCLUSION: For patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, thromboprophylaxis with DOACs is associated with a significant reduction of major VTE and DVT, compared to LMWH. Safety outcomes were not significantly different between both treatment groups.",

RT use has developed widespread interest due to the COVID‐19 pandemic, and has future potential to address the needs of a rapidly aging population, improve access to care, facilitate interprofessional team care, and ensure appropriate use of resources. However, despite rapid and increasing interest in implementation of RT, there is little research concerning practices for successful implementation. We conducted a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis of practices that impact the implementation of RT for adults seeking clinical care advice. We searched MEDLINE®, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception through July 2018. We included 32 studies in this review. Our review identified four themes impacting the implementation of RT: characteristics of staff who use RT, influence of RT on staff, considerations in selecting RT tools, and environmental and contextual factors impacting RT. The findings of our systemic review underscore the need for a careful consideration of (a) organizational and stakeholder buy‐in before launch, (b) physical and psychological workplace environment, (c) staff training and ongoing support, and (d) optimal metrics to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of implementation. Our findings indicate that preimplementation planning, as well as evaluating RT by collecting data during and after implementation, is essential to ensuring successful implementation and continued adoption of RT in a health care system.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) results in significant morbidity and mortality. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been standard of care for treatment of cancer-associated VTE, however direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are emerging as alternative treatment options. OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits and harms of DOACs versus LMWH for treatment of VTE in cancer. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to April 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing DOACs with LMWH for treatment of VTE in cancer patients. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four good-quality RCTs, met inclusion criteria. Compared with LMWH, DOACs were associated with lower rates of VTE recurrence (RR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44-0.87; P = 0.006), and DVT recurrence (RR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.4-0.94; P = 0.02) but not PE recurrence (RR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.51-1.04; P = 0.08), in cancer patients. However, the risk of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) (RR 1.58; 95% CI: 1.11-2.24; P = 0.01), and major bleeding in gastrointestinal cancer (RR 2.55; 95% CI 1.24-5.27, P = 0.01), were higher with DOACs. The risk of overall major bleeding (RR 1.33; 95% CI: 0.84-2.1; P = 0.22), all-cause mortality (RR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.84-1.17; P = 0.92), VTE-related mortality (RR: 1; 95% CI: 0.29-3.44; P = 1) and bleeding-related mortality (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.17-2.91; P = 0.63), were similar in both treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Among cancer patients with VTE, treatment with DOACs is associated with a significant reduction of VTE and DVT recurrence, compared to LMWH. These benefits were offset by an increased risk of CRNMB, and major bleeding in gastrointestinal cancer.",

Despite technologic advances, the effects of implementation of these systems on patient and utilization outcomes are unclear. We evaluated the effects of remote triage systems on healthcare utilization, case resolution, and patient safety outcomes. METHODS: English-language searches of MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and CINAHL were performed from inception until July 2018. Randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies of remote triage services that reported healthcare utilization, case resolution, and patient safety outcomes were included. Two reviewers assessed study and intervention characteristics independently for study quality, strength of evidence, and risk of bias. RESULTS: The literature search identified 5026 articles, of which eight met eligibility criteria. Five randomized, two controlled before-and-after, and one interrupted time series study assessed 3 categories of remote triage services: mode of delivery, triage professional type, and system organizational level. No study evaluated any other delivery mode other than telephone and in-person. Meta-analyses were unable to be performed because of study design and outcome heterogeneity; therefore, we narratively synthesized data. Overall, most studies did not demonstrate a decrease in primary care (PC) or emergency department (ED) utilization, with some studies showing a significant increase. Evidence suggested local, practice-based triage systems have greater case resolution and refer fewer patients to PC or ED services than regional/national systems. No study identified statistically significant differences in safety outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our review found limited evidence that remote triage reduces the burden of PC or ED utilization. However, remote triage by telephone can produce a high rate of call resolution and appears to be safe. Further study of other remote triage modalities is needed to realize the promise of remote triage services in optimizing healthcare outcomes. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: This study was registered and followed a published protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42019112262).",

AIM:: We evaluated the effects of integrated outpatient palliative and oncology care for advanced cancer on patient and caregiver outcomes. DESIGN:: Following a standard protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42017057541), investigators independently screened reports to identify randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies that evaluated the effect of integrated outpatient palliative and oncology care interventions on quality of life, survival, and healthcare utilization among adults with advanced cancer. Data were synthesized using random-effects meta-analyses, supplemented with qualitative methods when necessary. DATA SOURCES:: English-language peer-reviewed publications in PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central through November 2016. We subsequently updated our PubMed search through July 2018. RESULTS:: Eight randomized-controlled and two cluster-randomized trials were included. Most patients had multiple advanced cancers, with median time from diagnosis or recurrence to enrollment ranging from 8 to 12 weeks. All interventions included a multidisciplinary team, were classified as “moderately integrated,” and addressed physical and psychological symptoms. In a meta-analysis, short-term quality of life improved, symptom burden improved, and all-cause mortality decreased. Qualitative analyses revealed no association between integration elements, palliative care intervention elements, and intervention impact. Utilization and caregiver outcomes were often not reported. CONCLUSIONS:: Moderately integrated palliative and oncology outpatient interventions had positive effects on short-term quality of life, symptom burden, and survival. Evidence for effects on healthcare utilization and caregiver outcomes remains sparse.",

                  "abstract": "The US health care system currently faces several challenges including caring for an increasing elderly population, a large numbers of patients with multiple chronic conditions, and an uneven distribution of primary care providers across the country. The full appointment schedules of many primary care physicians compound this workforce shortage, making it challenging for many patients to access acute and chronic care within a primary care setting. Additionally, many patients experience multiple structural, financial, and logistical barriers to receiving timely care. In rural areas, for example, patients face challenges posed by distance to providers, decreased numbers of providers, and a lack of public transportation infrastructure to facilitate attending appointments. Such access challenges may lead people to seek acute or chronic care in settings such as emergency departments (EDs) when their needs could have likely been addressed in a primary care setting. Increasingly, acute care visits take place outside of the primary care setting. Yet patients who have access to after-hours care at their usual primary care practice have lower rates of higher level care utilization. One way of providing patient access to the appropriate level of care is through technology-based systems that facilitate remote decision-making. Remote decision-making is defined as making clinical decisions in the absence of a face-to-face encounter. Further, remote decision-making can overcome barriers such as demand for in-person clinical services. The implementation of any technology-based system is complex and requires evaluation of many factors at the patient, provider, and organizational levels. Factors related to the successful planning of such a system include the specific clinical and population contexts, the ability to sustain the process, and legal considerations around remote medical decision-making. Specific issues related to the execution of such a system include adaptability, complexity of the system, costs, external forces like incentives, and internal forces like supportive resources. Such systems have been successfully implemented in the United Kingdom, where patients requesting a same-day appointment by telephone are assessed and triaged to the appropriate level of care. Prior systematic reviews have reported that more research is necessary to determine the impact of triage and telephone consultation with patients on clinical outcomes, costs, and subsequent care utilization. As the country’s largest integrated health system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a mandate to care for Veterans across the entire United States and associated territories. Veterans established within VA may still experience barriers to accessing care, including multiple health comorbidities that limit travel, transportation concerns, or the need to access care after normal primary clinic hours. Thus, technology-based solutions to improve access are of significant interest in meeting VA’s responsibility “to care for [those] who shall have borne the battle.” Additionally, the recently passed MISSION Act specifically identifies telehealth via telephone or computer as channels for Veterans to receive timely care.",

                  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Vasomotor symptoms (VMSs) are the most common symptoms reported during menopause. Although hormone therapy is effective for reducing VMSs, its use is restricted in some women. Many women with VMSs thus seek nonhormonal, nonpharmacologic treatment options such as acupuncture. DESIGN: An umbrella systematic review (SR) was conducted, supplemented by a search of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), that assessed the effectiveness of acupuncture for VMSs, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and adverse effects of treatment in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model when data were sufficient. RESULTS: Three SRs and four new RCTs were identified that met eligibility criteria. Meta-analyses of this study revealed statistically significant standardized mean differences (SMDs) associated with acupuncture compared with no acupuncture at reducing VMS frequency (SMD -0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.06 to -0.26, I2 = 61.7%, 5 trials) and VMS severity (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.13, I2 = 18.1%, 4 trials) and improving HRQOL outcomes (SMD -0.93, 95% CI -1.20 to -0.67, I2 = 0.0%, 3 trials). SMDs were smaller or not statistically significant when acupuncture was compared with sham acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from RCTs supports the use of acupuncture as an adjunctive or stand-alone treatment for reducing VMSs and improving HRQOL outcomes, with the caveat that observed clinical benefit associated with acupuncture may be due, in part, or in whole to nonspecific effects. The safety of acupuncture in the treatment of VMSs has not been rigorously examined, but there is no clear signal for a significant potential for harm.",

Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a subset of AA defined by a more severe phenotype. Although the immunological nature of SAA pathogenesis is widely accepted, there is an increasing recognition of the role of dysfunctional hematopoietic stem cells in the disease phenotype. While pediatric SAA can be attributable to genetic causes, evidence is evolving on previously unrecognized genetic etiologies in a proportion of adults with SAA. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathophysiology of SAA, which will help to inform the course of disease progression and treatment options. We have derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) from three unaffected controls and three SAA patients and have shown that this in vitro model mimics two key features of the disease: (1) the failure to maintain telomere length during the reprogramming process and hematopoietic differentiation resulting in SAA-iPSC and iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors with shorter telomeres than controls; (2) the impaired ability of SAA-iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors to give rise to erythroid and myeloid cells. While apoptosis and DNA damage response to replicative stress is similar between the control and SAA-iPSC-derived-hematopoietic progenitors, the latter show impaired proliferation which was not restored by eltrombopag, a drug which has been shown to restore hematopoiesis in SAA patients. Together, our data highlight the utility of patient specific iPSC in providing a disease model for SAA and predicting patient responses to various treatment modalities.",

Chronically ill patients are at risk for depression, which can affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL), health care utilization, and cost. We performed an analytic epidemiologic prospective study to determine the prevalence of depression in adult patients with SCD and its association with HRQoL and medical resource utilization. Depression was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory and clinical history in adult SCD outpatients at a comprehensive SCD center. HRQoL was assessed using the SF36 form, and data were collected on medical resource utilization and corresponding cost. Neurocognitive functions were assessed using the CNS Vital Signs tool. Pain diaries were used to record daily pain. Out of 142 enrolled patients, 42 (35.2%) had depression. Depression was associated with worse physical and mental HRQoL scores (P < .0001 and P < .0001, respectively). Mean total inpatient costs ($25 000 vs $7487, P = .02) and total health care costs ($30 665 vs $13 016, P = .01) were significantly higher in patients with depression during the 12 months preceding diagnosis. Similarly, during the 6 months following diagnosis, mean total health care costs were significantly higher in depressed patients than in nondepressed patients ($13 766 vs $8670, P = .04). Depression is prevalent in adult patients with SCD and is associated with worse HRQoL and higher total health care costs.

While hormone therapy is an effective treatment, its use is limited by concerns about possible harms. Thus, many women with VMS seek nonhormonal, nonpharmacologic treatment options. However, evidence to guide clinical recommendations is inconclusive. This study reviewed the effectiveness of yoga, tai chi and qigong on vasomotor, psychological symptoms, and HRQoL in peri- or post-menopausal women. DESIGN: MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database were searched. Researchers identified systematic reviews (SR) or RCTs that evaluated yoga, tai chi, or qigong for vasomotor, psychological symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in peri- or post-menopausal women. Data were abstracted on study design, participants, interventions and outcomes. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed and updated meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: We identified one high-quality SR (5 RCTs, 582 participants) and 3 new RCTs (345 participants) published after the SR evaluating yoga for vasomotor, psychological symptoms, and HRQoL; no studies evaluated tai chi or qigong. Updated meta-analyses indicate that, compared to controls, yoga reduced VMS (5 trials, standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.05) and psychological symptoms (6 trials, SDM -0.32; 95% CI -0.47 to -0.17). Effects on quality of life were reported infrequently. Key limitations are that adverse effects were rarely reported and outcome measures lacked standardization.

Consequently, the oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the left, which leads to tissue hypoxia and ultimately may cause death. Acquired methemoglobinemia can be due to a host of offending agents and chemicals including nitrites, local anesthetics, aniline and antimalarial drugs. There are several approaches to the management of methemoglobinemia. The first step is to stop the offending agent and initiate supportive measures. Methylene blue can be used successfully provided the patient has no evidence of glucose 6 phosphate deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen and intravenous ascorbic acid are other treatment options. We present a case of unusually severe methemoglobinemia (82% methemoglobin) secondary to occupational exposure that failed to respond to several lines of management including methylene blue, red cell exchange, intravenous ascorbic acid, and hyperbaric oxygen. However, the patient responded swiftly to plasmapheresis started upon suspicion of concomitant thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and he subsequently recovered completely. Thus, plasmapheresis may have a role in severe methemoglonbinemia unresponsive to standard treatment options.",

This study investigates changes in leucocyte subsets and the relationship between cell adhesion molecule expression and disease manifestations in patients during steady state and acute VOC. We compared soluble E-selectin and P-selectin levels in 84 SCD patients, in steady state and during VOC to 84 healthy controls. Using immunophenotyping, we also compared lymphocyte subsets in these three groups. Further, we compared E-selectin and P-selectin levels in patients of Saudi ethnicity to non-Saudi patients, in all three groups. Lymphocyte subsets showed high percentages of total T lymphocytes, T helper and suppressor lymphocytes, B lymphocytes as well as NK cells in patients with SCD during steady state, while B lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly higher during acute VOC crisis. High levels of both soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) and soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) markers were demonstrated in the serum of patients with SCD during both steady state and acute VOC. Levels of selectins were significantly higher in acute VOC. The immunophenotypic expression of L-selectin, on leucocytes, was high in SCD both during steady state and during acute VOC in comparison to normal control subjects. There was no significant difference in all three study groups between Saudi and non-Saudi patients. These findings suggest that patients with SCD have increased expression of adhesion molecules: E-selectin and P-selectin, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of VOC. Despite the distinct phenotype of Saudi patients with SCD, there was no significant difference in levels of soluble E-selectin and soluble P-selectin between Saudi and non-Saudi patients in all three groups. While sickle cell disease is a well-recognized state of chronic inflammation, the role of specific adhesion molecules is steadily unraveling. Studies are underway to investigate the potential role of selectin antagonists, for prevention and reversal of acute vascular occlusions in SCD patients.",

                  "abstract": "Thalassemia is a disorder of hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis characterized by chronic hemolysis. In β-thalassemias major (β-TM), patients require regular transfusion at an early age due to severe anemia. Subsequently, intensive chelation therapy is initiated to mitigate the effects of the resultant iron overload. Clinical disease burden and the demanding treatment can affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes in this population. The aim of this study was to assess HRQoL outcomes in Egyptian pediatric thalassemia patients. Patients were enrolled simultaneously from the hematology clinic at the National Research Institute in Cairo, Egypt. The Arabic version of SF36 tool was used to assess HRQoL outcomes. Socioeconomic data were collected by patient and parent interviews. Clinical data were collected by review of medical records. One hundred and thirty patients and 60 controls were enrolled, with a mean age of 5.4 ± 3.2 years and 6.3 ± 3.0, respectively. The HRQoL outcome scores were lower in all domains in the thalassemia group compared to the control group (p = 0.0001). Transfusion-dependent (TD) patients had lower HRQoL scores compared to nontransfusion-dependent (NTD) patients (p = 0.0001). Patient education and maternal education were independently associated with better HRQoL scores (p = 0.007, p = 0.028, respectively). Residents of rural areas reported lower scores compared to urban residents (p = 0.026). Thalassemia was associated with lower HRQoL scores, in all domains, compared to HRQoL in unaffected controls. Chronic transfusion independence, patient education, and maternal education were all associated with higher HRQoL scores. Psychological, social, and economic support for families with thalassemia are all essential tools to improve HRQoL outcomes.",

These symptoms can be effectively managed with hormone therapy, but safety concerns limit its use. Thus, understanding the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic therapies such as acupuncture or yoga is critical to managing these common symptoms in older women. Our review seeks to address the following question: In women with menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms, what are the effects on health-related quality of life, vasomotor symptoms, and adverse events of the following nonpharmacologic, nonherbal interventions as compared with any inactive control or active comparator: (a) acupuncture, (b) yoga, tai chi, and qigong, (c) structured exercise, and (d) meditation, mindfulness-based practices, and relaxation? METHODS: We describe a protocol for an umbrella review approach, supplemented by evaluating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published after the most recent good-quality systematic review for each of the eligible interventions. Specific interventions were chosen based on current literature and with input from a technical expert panel and organizational stakeholders. We will conduct a thorough literature search and perform a quality assessment of potentially included systematic reviews and RCTs. DISCUSSION: Our umbrella review, supplemented by an additional search for eligible RCTs, aims to synthesize existing evidence on the use of nonpharmacologic, nonherbal interventions to manage bothersome vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thromboprophylaxis regimens include pharmacologic and mechanical options such as intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCDs). There are a wide variety of IPCDs available, but it is uncertain if they vary in effectiveness or ease of use. This is a systematic review of the comparative effectiveness of IPCDs for selected outcomes (mortality, venous thromboembolism [VTE], symptomatic or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis, major bleeding, ease of use, and adherence) in postoperative surgical patients. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL from January 1, 1995, to October 30, 2014, for randomized controlled trials, as well as relevant observational studies on ease of use and adherence. RESULTS: We identified 14 eligible randomized controlled trials (2633 subjects) and 3 eligible observational studies (1724 subjects); most were conducted in joint arthroplasty patients. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices were comparable to anticoagulation for major clinical outcomes (VTE: risk ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.73-2.64). Limited data suggest that concurrent use of anticoagulation with IPCD may lower VTE risk compared with anticoagulation alone, and that IPCD compared with anticoagulation may lower major bleeding risk. Subgroup analyses did not show significant differences by device location, mode of inflation, or risk of bias elements. There were no consistent associations between IPCDs and ease of use or adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent pneumatic compression devices are appropriate for VTE thromboprophylaxis when used in accordance with current clinical guidelines. The current evidence base to guide selection of a specific device or type of device is limited.",

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of African American women receiving prenatal care from 1991 to 2006. Sickle cell status was ascertained by routine hemoglobin electrophoresis. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) was defined as one or more episodes of deep venous and/or pulmonary thromboembolism during pregnancy or the puerperium according to discharge diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. RESULTS: Among 22,140 women with hemoglobin (Hb) AA status, 20 women (0.09%) experienced pregnancy-related VTE compared with 3 women (0.15%) of 2,037 women with Hb AS; relative risk (RR) for the association with AS status = 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5 to 5.5. Of 103 women, 3 women (2.9%) with sickle cell disease conditions (Hb SS, Hb SC, or Hb S,beta-thalassemia) experienced thromboembolism. Compared with women with Hb AA status, the RR = 32.2, 95% CI 9.7 to 107. CONCLUSION: Sickle cell trait may be associated with a modest increase in VTE in the setting of pregnancy; sickle cell disease conditions are strongly associated with this rare but potentially fatal outcome.",

New oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors, are emerging options for thromboprophylaxis after these procedures. PURPOSE: To compare the benefits and risks of NOACs versus standard thromboprophylaxis for adults having THR or TKR. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 2009 through March 2013. STUDY SELECTION: English-language systematic reviews. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers abstracted data and rated study quality and strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Six good-quality systematic reviews compared NOACs with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for thromboprophylaxis after THR or TKR. Risk for symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, but not risk for death or nonfatal pulmonary embolism, was reduced with factor Xa inhibitors compared with LMWH (4 fewer events per 1000 patients). Conversely, the risk for major bleeding increased (2 more events per 1000 patients). Outcomes of dabigatran did not significantly differ from those of LMWH. Indirect evaluation of NOACs by common comparison with LMWH showed nonsignificantly reduced risks for venous thromboembolism with rivaroxaban compared with dabigatran (risk ratio [RR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.21 to 2.23]) and apixaban (RR, 0.59 [CI, 0.26 to 1.33]) but increased major bleeding. New oral anticoagulants have not been compared with warfarin, aspirin, or unfractionated heparin. LIMITATIONS: Head-to-head comparisons among NOACs were not available. Efficacy is uncertain in routine clinical practice. CONCLUSION: New oral anticoagulants are effective for thromboprophylaxis after THR and TKR. Their clinical benefits over LMWH are marginal and offset by increased risk for major bleeding. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.",

PURPOSE: To compare the benefits and harms of NOACs versus warfarin for AF and VTE. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 2001 through July 2012; U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database for adverse event reports. STUDY SELECTION: English-language, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NOACs with warfarin for management of AF or VTE and observational studies and FDA reports on adverse effects. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers abstracted data and rated study quality and strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Six good-quality RCTs compared NOACs (2 DTI studies, 4 FXa inhibitor studies) with warfarin. In AF, NOACs decreased all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.82 to 0.96]); in VTE, NOACs did not differ for mortality or VTE outcomes. Across indications, adverse effects of NOACs compared with warfarin were fatal bleeding (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.46 to 0.77]), major bleeding (RR, 0.80 [CI, 0.63 to 1.01]), gastrointestinal bleeding (RR, 1.30 [CI, 0.97 to 1.73]), and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR, 1.23 [CI, 1.05 to 1.44]). Subgroup analyses suggest a higher risk for myocardial infarction with DTIs than with FXa inhibitors. Bleeding risk for NOACs may be increased in persons older than 75 years or those receiving warfarin who have good control. LIMITATION: There were no head-to-head comparisons of NOACs and limited data on harms. CONCLUSION: New oral anticoagulants are a viable option for patients receiving long-term anticoagulation.

Objective: To evaluatethe prevalence, presentation and management of inherited bleeding disorders. Setting: Hematology Department, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. Design: Retrospective study. Method:Sixty-fourpatients withinherited bleeding disorders were included in the study from January 2000 to January 2011.Clinical, baseline coagulation screen, factor assay and serological testing were collected. Result: Thirty-one patients (48.4%) were diagnosed with hemophilia A,eighteen patients (28.1%) had von Willebrand disease, eleven patients (17.9%) had Hemophilia B and four patients had other factor deficiencies. Elevenpatients with Hemophilia A and one patient with Hemophilia B had severe disease. The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection was 5%. All patients were negative for hepatitis B S Ag and human immune deficiency virus antibodies. Conclusion: The distribution of hereditary bleeding disorders reported in this study is similar to other studies; however, the prevalence of von Willebrand disease was lower than expected.We believe there is under-representation of bleeding disorders in our referral population due to lack of awareness and diagnostic expertise in remote areas of the Western region.

Although opioid analgesics are widely used, to date there have been no studies on the relationship of daily opioid use to quality of life (QoL) measures in this population. Objective: To determine the relationship of opioid analgesia to QoL in adults with SCD. Design: There were 185 outpatients with various SCD genotypes evaluated. Data were collected by patient interviews as well as review of medical records. QoL as determined by the Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) was the main outcome measured. Results: QoL outcomes were not lower in the classically more severe homozygous SS individuals when compared with the heterozygous SC patients. However, SF-36 scores were significantly lower in individuals using opioids daily compared with those who did not, in all age groups and for all diagnoses. When controlling for hydroxyurea use, the negative association between opioid use and QoL scores remained unchanged. QoL scores were significantly higher in those who were either on no medications or on hydroxyurea alone, as compared with those who were on opioids alone or on hydroxyurea and opioids concurrently. Disease severity scores were not different between medication groups. Conclusions: SCD patients on daily opioids had poorer QoL scores than those who were not on opioids, independent of disease severity. Hydroxyurea had a positive impact on QoL, although that effect was not observed in patients also using chronic opioids. Prospective studies are needed to define the relationship of opioid use to QoL and the significance of the interaction of both drugs in SCD. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

                  "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is reported to be associated with measures of renal function in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the relationship between albuminuria and both clinical and laboratory variables in SCD. Design and methods: This cross-sectional study was performed using a cohort of adult patients with SCD and control subjects without SCD. Spot urine for microalbumincreatinine ratio, measures of hemolysis, inflammation and other laboratory studies were obtained. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was determined by Doppler echocardiography, and the diagnosis of PHT was defined using age-, sex- and body mass index-adjusted reference ranges. Results: Seventy-three patients with SCD and 21 healthy, race-matched control subjects were evaluated. In patients with SCD, normoalbuminuria was observed in 34 patients (46.6%), microalbuminuria in 24 patients (32.9%) and macroalbuminuria in 15 patients (20.5%). There was a significant correlation between urine albumin excretion and age. In patients with HbSS and S0 thalassemia, the levels of sFLT-1, soluble VCAM and NT pro-BNP were significantly higher in those with macroalbuminuria, compared to patients with microalbuminuria and normoalbuminura, but no significant differences were observed in the levels of laboratory measures of hemolysis. Urine albumin excretion was associated with PHT and a history of stroke. Conclusions: Our study confirms the high prevalence of albuminuria in SCD. The association of urine albumin excretion with sFLT-1 suggests that this vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family member may contribute to the development of albuminuria in SCD. By inducing endothelial activation and endothelial dysfunction, sFLT-1 appears to be a link between glomerulopathy and PHT in SCD. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons AS.",

                  "abstract": "The D-dimer antigen is a unique marker of fibrin degradation that is formed by the sequential action of 3 enzymes: thrombin, factor XIIIa, and plasmin. First, thrombin cleaves fibrinogen producing fibrin monomers, which polymerize and serve as a template for factor XIIIa and plasmin formation. Second, thrombin activates plasma factor XIII bound to fibrin polymers to produce the active transglutaminase, factor XIIIa. Factor XIIIa catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds between D-domains in the polymerized fibrin. Finally, plasmin degrades the crosslinked fibrin to release fibrin degradation products and expose the D-dimer antigen. D-dimer antigen can exist on fibrin degradation products derived from soluble fibrin before its incorporation into a fibrin gel, or after the fibrin clot has been degraded by plasmin. The clinical utility of D-dimer measurement has been established in some scenarios, most notably for the exclusion of VTE. This article consists of 2 sections: in the first, the dynamics of D-dimer antigen formation is discussed and an overview of commercially available D-dimer assays is provided. The second section reviews available evidence for the clinical utilization of D-dimer antigen measurement in VTE, as well as emerging areas of D-dimer utilization as a marker of coagulation activation in other clinical settings.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease patients are more likely than the general population to undergo surgery and usually do so at a younger age. Female sickle cell disease patients also have special gynecological and obstetric issues related to their disease. METHODS: We collected data through standardized clinical report forms, patient interviews, and medical records from 509 adult sickle cell disease patients. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between multiple variables and each of the surgery types. We also determined the prevalence and outcomes of pregnancy in 284 women with sickle cell disease in this population. RESULTS: Almost 50% of patients aged 18-27 years had had a cholecystectomy. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in the postcholecystectomy group; 9.5% of 504 individuals had undergone splenectomy. Hematocrit, body mass index, and red blood cell count were significantly higher in the postsplenectomy group. Hip replacement had been performed in 9.2% of individuals, with the prevalence increasing as early as the fourth decade and continuing to increase through the sixth decade of life. A history of pregnancy was present in 190 women (67%). Of 410 pregnancies, only 53.9% resulted in live births, 16.6% were voluntarily terminated, and 29.5% were complicated by miscarriage, still birth, or ectopic implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Sickle cell disease continues to have a strong effect on the mean age for common surgeries and impacts pregnancy outcomes. We conclude that this population has a unique surgical and obstetric history that should be further studied to provide insight into potentially more effective preventive approaches to end-organ damage.",

Hydroxyurea (HU) therapy is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality as well as improved patient health outcomes (Charache et al, 1995 and Steinberg et al, 2003). However, the effect of chronic opiate pain management on HU treatment outcomes is unknown. In the current study, we evaluated the effects of HU and chronic long acting opiate therapy-OxyContin, methadone, fentanyl and MS Contin-on the following laboratory parameters: white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Changes in these variables are known to be linked with HU effects on morbidity and mortality in SCD. 142 homozygous sickle cell anemia patients (75 females and 67 males) from the outpatient clinic at Duke University Medical Center were included in this study. Clinical data were collected by patient interview as well as review of medical records after informed consent. Patients were classified in 4 groups based on report of chronic daily use of long acting opiates and/or HU (current therapy with HU) as follows: No HU or opiates (None); opiates only; HU only; and HU and opiates. ANOVAs were used to identify combined effects of opiate therapy, HU therapy and the 3 laboratory parameters. Overall, we found that patients on HU (n=76, 54%), had lower WBC and higher Hb and MCV than the no HU patients (n=66, 46%), with p&lt;.01 for all associations, as could be expected. In contrast to the positive effects of HU, patients on opiates had higher WBC than non opiate patients (p&lt;.01). Surprisingly, when adjusting for gender and age, opiate therapy appeared to moderate the effect of HU treatment on WBC (p=.05) and MCV (p=.04). Patients who were on HU and opiates concurrently exhibited 17% higher WBC and 6% lower MCV than patients who were on HU alone, suggesting that opiate therapy may be attenuating the positive effects of HU. The findings from the current study confirm that HU treatment is associated with better patient health indices, i.e. lower WBC, higher Hb and MCV. In contrast, chronic opiate pain management, often a concomitant therapy with HU, was associated with poorer patient laboratory indices, both with or without concurrent HU treatment. Overall, these data indicate that the chronic use of opiates may decrease the efficacy of HU treatment in this patient population. Further studies are needed to study the mechanism of drug interaction between opiate and HU in SCD patients. The previously suggested inhibitory effect of HU on the cytochrome P450 CYP3A, an important cytochrome in the metabolism of some opiates (Reardon et al, 2005), should be considered for future studies of drug-drug interaction in SCD.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure Figure</jats:p>",

Design: This is a retrospective study of sixty patients of CML and their follow up over 20 years. Ten clinical and laboratory features of the disease were evaluated for their prognostic significance. All patients received cytoreductive therapy. Setting: All patients were seen at King Abdul Aziz University Hospital and the National Guard Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Method: The prognostic value of sex, age, white cell, basophils, promyelocytes and platelet counts, splenomegaly, bone marrow (BM) blast count, BM fibrosis and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, was assessed using log-rank tests. All variables significantly associated with survival univariately were included in a Cox regression. The time to either death or transformation from date of diagnosis was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Results: Splenomegaly greater than or equal to 13 cm and a bone marrow blast count of greater than 10% at diagnosis, were both found to be significantly associated with a high-risk of transformation or death in this population. Other presenting features studied, did not have a statistically- significant prognostic impact. Conclusion: The median duration of the chronic phase in the studied group of patients was 120 months. Splenomegaly and a high BM blast count were both associated with a risk of transformation or death in this population.",

Fusion biopsy (FB) offers improved diagnostic accuracy, but the pain and anxiety experienced by patients during biopsies is often overlooked. This study aims to compare pain and anxiety levels between standard TRUS-guided biopsy (STB) and systematic plus MRI/US fusion biopsy (STB + FB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved adult men undergoing biopsies, receiving identical peri-procedural care, including 2% lidocaine jelly in the rectum and subsequent 1% lidocaine injections (10cc per side) into the prostate-seminal vesicle junction and prostatic apical areas bilaterally. The biopsy technique was chosen based on clinical and imaging findings. Pre- and post-biopsy anxiety levels were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire, categorized as mild (20-37), moderate (38-44), or severe (45-80). Post-biopsy pain was evaluated on a numerical rating scale, ranging from 0 to 10. RESULTS: Of the 165 patients, 99 underwent STB, and 66 underwent STB + FB. No significant differences were observed in age, race, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, or prior biopsies between the groups. The STB + FB group had more biopsy cores taken (16.2 vs. 12, p = 0.001) and a longer procedure time (23 vs. 10 min, p = 0.001). STB biopsy patients experienced lower post-procedural anxiety compared to STB + FB, with a mean difference of -7 (p = 0.001, d = 0.92). In the STB + FB group, 89% experienced severe post-procedural anxiety compared to 59% in STB (p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in post-procedural pain (p = 0.7). Patients with prior biopsies had significantly higher STAI(S) anxiety scores (p = 0.005), and the number of prior biopsies correlated with anxiety severity (p = 0.04) in STB + FB group. CONCLUSION: In summary, STB + FB group demonstrated higher post-procedural anxiety levels than the STB group, with no difference in pain levels. Additionally, patients with a history of repeat biopsies were more likely to exhibit higher STAI(S) anxiety scores.",

The success of immunotherapy in prostate cancer treatment has been limited to specific populations with advanced disease, which is thought to be a result of prostate cancer being an immunologically 'cold' cancer. Accordingly, combining intratumoural immunotherapy with other treatments that would increase the immunological heat of prostate cancer is of interest. Thermal ablation therapy is currently one of the main strategies used for the treatment of localized prostate cancer and it causes immunological activation against prostate tissue. The use of intratumoural immunotherapy as an adjunct to thermal ablation offers the potential to elicit a systemic and lasting adaptive immune response to cancer-specific antigens, leading to a synergistic effect of combination therapy. The combination of thermal ablation and immunotherapy is currently in the early stages of investigation for the treatment of multiple solid tumour types, and the potential for this combination therapy to also offer benefit to prostate cancer patients is exciting.",

This review aims to provide an overview of the evaluation of patients with recurrent disease after radiation therapy and how it is continuing to evolve with increasing data on outcomes, as well as improving technologies and techniques. Our enhanced understanding of treatment outcomes and risk stratification has influenced the identification of patients who may benefit from local salvage treatment. Advances in imaging and biopsy techniques have enhanced the accuracy of locating the recurrence, which affects treatment decisions. Additionally, the growing interest in image-targeted ablative therapies that have less morbidity and complications than whole-gland therapies for suitable patients influences the evaluation process for those considering focal salvage therapy.

Previous systematic reviews supported evidence for favorable functional outcomes, but oncological outcomes were inconclusive owing to limited follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world data on the mid- to long-term oncological and functional outcomes of whole-gland cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with clinically localized PCa, and to provide expert recommendations and commentary on these findings. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library publications through February 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. As endpoints, baseline clinical characteristics, and oncological and functional outcomes were assessed. To estimate the pooled prevalence of oncological, functional, and toxicity outcomes, and to quantify and explain the heterogeneity, random-effect meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-nine studies were identified, including 14 on cryoablation and 15 on HIFU with a median follow-up of 72 mo. Most of the studies were retrospective (n = 23), with IDEAL (idea, development, exploration, assessment, and long-term study) stage 2b (n = 20) being most common. Biochemical recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free survival rates at 10 yr were 58%, 96%, 63%, 71-79%, and 84%, respectively. Erectile function was preserved in 37% of cases, and overall pad-free continence was achieved in 96% of cases, with a 1-yr rate of 97.4-98.8%. The rates of stricture, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, rectourethral fistula, and sepsis were observed to be 11%, 9.5%, 8%, 0.7%, and 0.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The mid- to long-term real-world data, and the safety profiles of cryoablation and HIFU are sound to support and be offered as primary treatment for appropriate patients with localized PCa. When compared with other existing treatment modalities for PCa, these ablative therapies provide nearly equivalent intermediate- to long-term oncological and toxicity outcomes, as well as excellent pad-free continence rates in the primary setting. This real-world clinical evidence provides long-term oncological and functional outcomes that enhance shared decision-making when balancing risks and expected outcomes that reflect patient preferences and values. PATIENT SUMMARY: Cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound are minimally invasive treatments available to selectively treat localized prostate cancer, considering their nearly comparable intermediate- to long term cancer control and preservation of urinary continence to other radical treatments in the primary setting. However, a well-informed decision should be made based on one's values and preferences.",

Oncologic and functional outcomes of patients who underwent SCT after primary XRT (XRT-SCT) or cryoablation (CRYO-SCT) were studied. METHODS: Data was collected using the Duke Prostate Cancer database and the Cryo On-Line Data (COLD) registry. The primary outcome was biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS).  Urinary incontinence, rectourethral fistula, and erectile dysfunction were secondary outcomes. The Kaplan-Meier log-rank test and univariable/multivariable Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models were utilized to evaluate BPFS between groups. RESULTS: 419 XRT-SCT and 63 CRYO-SCT patients met inclusion criteria, that was reduced to 63 patients in each cohort after propensity matching. There was no difference in BPFS at 2 and 5 years both before (P = .5 and P = .7) and after matching (P = .6 and P = .3). On multivariable CPH, BPFS was comparable between treatment groups (CRYO-SCT, HR=1.1, [0.2-2.2]).  On the same analysis, BPFS was lower in D'Amico high-risk (HR 3.2, P < .01) and intermediate-risk (HR 1.95, P < .05) categories compared to low-risk. There was no significant difference in functional outcomes between cohorts. CONCLUSION: Following primary cryotherapy, salvage cryoablation provides comparable intermediate oncological outcomes and functional outcomes compared to primary radiotherapy.",

                  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Salvage cryotherapy (SCT) is widely used to treat prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence after radiotherapy (RT). We studied the intermediate oncological and functional outcomes of patients who underwent SCT following cryotherapy (CRYO-SCT) recurrence and compare it to recurrence after brachytherapy (BT-SCT). METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective cohort study utilizing patient data from the Cryo On-Line Data Registry and the Duke PCa database between 1992 and 2016. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) using Phoenix criteria was the primary endpoint assessed at 2- and 5-years post-SCT. Secondary endpoints assessed functional outcomes including urinary continence, erectile function, and recto-urethral fistula. Association between treatment and biochemical progression-free survival was assessed using inverse probability weighted (IPTW) Cox proportional hazards regression. The differences in the secondary functional outcomes were assessed by Pearson's χ2 test or Fisher's exact test, corrected for IPTW. RESULTS: A total of 194 patients met inclusion criteria. The BCR rate for BT-SCT and CRYO-SCT was 23 (20.4%) and 17 (21%) at 2 years and 30 (26.5%) and 22 (27.2%) at 5 years according to Phoenix criteria. There was no statistical difference in 2 years (hazard ratio [HR] 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-1.7, p = 0.7) or 5-year BCR (HR: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.5-1.5, p = 0.6) between the groups. The functional outcomes like urinary continence (p = 0.4), erectile function (p = 0.1), and recto-urethral fistula (p = 0.3) were not statistically different. CONCLUSION: CRYO-SCT appears to be well tolerated, with comparable oncological and functional outcomes to patients failing primary BT. The findings also demonstrated that SCT can render a significant number of patients biochemically free of disease after initial CRYO with minimal morbidity. SCT is a viable treatment option to salvage local PCa recurrence following either BT or cryoablation failure.",

Because of this, patients with urologic prosthetics sometimes present challenges during future nonprosthetic operations. Presently, there is no established guideline for device management with ensuing inguinal or pelvic surgery. AIMS: This article outlines concerns during pelvic and inguinal surgery for patients with an artificial urinary sphincter and/or inflatable penile prosthesis and proposes an algorithm for preoperative surgical planning and decision making. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature on operative management of these prosthetic devices. Publications were identified by searching electronic databases. Only peer-reviewed publications available in English were considered for this review. RESULTS: We review the important considerations as well as available options for operative management of these prosthetic devices during subsequent nonprosthetic surgery and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each. Finally, we suggest a framework for helping surgeons determine which management strategy is most appropriate for their individual patients. CONCLUSION: The best management strategy will differ depending on patient values, the planned surgery, and patient-specific factors. Surgeons should understand and counsel patients on all available options and encourage informed, shared decision making to determine the best individualized approach.",

                  "abstract": "PURPOSE: PI-RADS 4 lesions are considered to have a \"high\" likelihood of clinically-significant prostate cancer (csPCa). However, patients undergoing targeted biopsy have a range of histologic findings. Understanding discordant cases is critical to improve diagnostic accuracy and inform subsequent management. We studied early findings from implementation of a multidisciplinary Quality Improvement (QI) protocol for reconciling discordance and evaluate the potential heterogeneity of PI-RADS 4. METHODS: Patients with mpMRI PI-RADS 4 lesions undergoing fusion-targeted biopsy from January 2017 to May 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The discordant targeted biopsy pathology (benign/GG1) was evaluated utilizing a QI protocol and all lesions were subcategorized based on ADC values. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) for PI-RADS 4 lesions overall and the Cancer Detection Rate (CDR) for subcategorized lesions were calculated. RESULTS: 248 patients with 286 lesions were reviewed. Prior to re-review, PI-RADS 4 PPV for ≥ GG1 and ≥ GG2 lesions were 0.55 and 0.34, increasing to 0.67 and 0.43 following reconciliation. Lesion subcategorization based on ADC value as higher suspicion (4+) and lower suspicion (4-) resulted in 158 and 117 lesions, with reverse-fusion analysis revealing that 61% and 17% of lesions contained csPCa, respectively. Subgroup analysis among PI-RADS 4+ lesions led to an increase in the CDR to 75% and 61% for ≥ GG1 and ≥ GG2. CONCLUSION: Use of multidisciplinary QI protocol to review discordance cases of PI-RADS 4 improves diagnostic accuracy and guides subsequent management. Our findings highlight the known heterogeneity of this category with reference to csPCa CDR, suggesting the potential value of PI-RADS 4 subcategorization.",

However, not all patients in this older age group are surgical candidates owing to their comorbidities. Cryoablation is a well-established minimally invasive technique for the treatment of small renal masses. The advent of less invasive ablative treatment has alleviated the surgical dilemma for certain patients who are contraindicated for extirpative procedures. With the appropriate patient selection, cryoablation is safe and effective, resulting in comparable local tumor control, fewer complications, better preservation of renal function, a faster recovery, and a shorter hospital stay. The percutaneous procedure has increased in popularity due to the advantages of reduced pain, shorter hospitalization, the ability to be performed without general anesthesia, and decreased cost relative to surgery.",

METHODS: Historical photographs were identified from the Web sites of the National Library of Medicine, Google, and the archives of the Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology for the 11 decades 1860 to 1970. The presence or absence of each article of clothing was then determined for the surgical and anesthesia providers depicted. RESULTS: Over 1,000 photographs were identified and examined. Photographs were then eliminated for repetition, lack of available dating, questionable dating, and poor quality. In 338 remaining photographs that met inclusion criteria, 640 surgical providers and 219 anesthesia providers were depicted and used in the analysis. Statistical definitions for historical terms general acceptance and routine use were proposed. The probability that a surgeon was wearing nonstreet clothes (gown) was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.93) in 1863. The years (95% lower bound to 95% upper bound) associated with a 0.5 probability for wearing cap, gloves, and mask were 1900 (1896 to 1904), 1907 (1903 to 1910), and 1916 (1913 to 1919), respectively. The years associated with a 0.5 probability that an anesthesia provider would be wearing nonstreet clothes (gown), cap, and mask were 1883 (1863 to 1889), 1905 (1900 to 1911), and 1932 (1929 to 1937), respectively. CONCLUSION: Timelines for the adoption of each basic article of surgical attire by surgeons and anesthesia providers were determined by analysis of historical operating room photographs from 1863 to 1969.",
